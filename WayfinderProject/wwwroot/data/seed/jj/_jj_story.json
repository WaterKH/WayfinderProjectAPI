One day, Sora, ventured into the island's secret cave and met a stranger who had come from \"beyond the door.\" That night, disaster struck Sora's island. Riku and Kairi disappeared, and Sora was left with a mysterious weapon. With it, he defeated monsters that had suddenly appeared everywhere, spawned from an enormous sphere of darkness. But the darkness swallowed the island. Meanwhile, Disney Castle was in an uproar. King Mickey had vanished, leaving only a note behind. With this sole clue, Donald and Goofy set out to find him. Somehow, Sora ended up in a place called Traverse Town, where he met Leon, Aerith, and Yuffie and learned about the Heartless - beings of darkness - and the secret behind his weapon, the Keyblade. It is the key to unlocking some great power. Before long, Sora also met Donald and Goofy, who were looking for Leon, and joined forces with them.",

        "Description": "Guided by a voice calling out to him, Sora awoke in a mysterious old mansion. He must have been sleeping there for a long time, but he couldn't remember a thing. \r\nStepping outside, he found the town strangely familiar, even though he had never been there before. \r\nSora was wandering around Twilight Town as puzzled as ever when he met Hayner, Pence, and Olette in the back alley. They said they'd seen someone at the station who was looking for Sora and his friends. From the sounds of things, it must be the King. \r\nSora and his friends hurried to the station, but suddenly found themselves surrounded by swarms of foes. The black-clad warrior who rescued them from their predicament was none other than the King himself! There was little time to celebrate their reunion. \"You gotta board the train and leave town!\" said the King, who gave Sora a pouch of munny before disappearing. But if the King had been locked away in the realm of darkness and was safe and sound, that meant Riku must be, too. Sora made up his mind to search for Riku: \"He and I can go back to the islands together. Kairi's there waiting for us!\" Donald and Goofy agreed to come along too, of course. \r\nIt was time for them to set out on their next journey. Just like the King said, they had to take a train out of town; they said goodbye to Hayner and the others, who had come to the station to see them off. \r\nIt was a tearful farewell, even though Sora had only just met the three friends... Still feeling strangely sad, they rode the train to the base of a lonely tower. \r\nDonald and Goofy knew the fellow at the tower entrance - Pete, who was never up to any good. The King had banished him to another dimension, but the sorceress Maleficent freed Pete, who served her now. He was gathering an army of Heartless and had his eye on making a Heartless out of the King's teacher, Master Yen Sid. \r\nThe tower was overflowing with Heartless. Master Yen Sid was waiting for Sora and his friends when they finally made their way to the top: \"Chosen wielder of the Keyblade! You are the key that will open the door to light.\" \r\nAccording to Yen Sid, the light was under a new threat from the enemies called \"Nobodies.\" These were the empty shells left behind when someone with a strong heart became a Heartless, yet they had purpose and will they could act on. A group called Organization XIII was controlling these Nobodies, although their goals are still unknown. The King is on a journey to discover what exactly Organization XIII is trying to accomplish, and if they find the King, they'll likely know where Riku is, too. \r\nSora decided to go out in search of the King, but needed to change out of his too-small outfit first. \r\nThe three good fairies gave Sora enchanted garments in preparation for his journey. \r\nAll that was left was to set sail in the Gummi ship Master Yen Sid had prepared. If they opened the gates as indicated by the beam of light streaming from the Keyblade, new paths should appear one after the other, connecting the worlds once more. Yes, everything is connected, even hearts that are far apart and out of reach. A new adventure awaits! \r\nThey arrived in Twilight Town again to find Vivi desperately searching for help. \r\nSora and friends ran to the sandlot and defeated the Nobodies who were threatening Seifer and his gang. Saïx, a member of Organization XIII, appeared to give the group a warning. It seems Axel had gone AWOL and was aiming to turn Sora into a Heartless. He then made a fleeting remark about Riku before vanishing into the darkness. Seifer tried to get Sora to accept a trophy proclaiming him the strongest guy in town. That's when a flustered Pence came by and asked, \"You know somebody named Kairi?\" \r\nKairi had come to Twilight Town in search of Sora, but Axel had kidnapped her. \"I gotta help Kairi!\" Sora exclaimed. Just then the crystal from Seifer's trophy began to glow, and a new road was opened. Surely this road led to Kairi and Riku - and so believing, Sora and his friends were on their way to find them. \r\nThe box found in the realm of darkness held some ice cream and photos of the old mansion in Twilight Town. \r\nSora and his friends came by the mansion searching for clues, only to find Hayner and his friends recovering after being attacked by Heartless. Olette said they thought the old mansion was some kind of gateway to an alternate Twilight Town. \"What do you mean, alternate?\" For some strange reason, Sora and friends found they had duplicates of the handmade pouch and crystals that had supposedly been one of a kind. This proved that there was a Twilight Town \"out there\" that closely resembled the one \"over here.\" \"That other town must be where whatever's missing from here went!\" said Pence. If Kairi had disappeared from this Twilight Town... could she be waiting in the other one? That's when the King appeared. He was on the trail of Ansem the Wise, who was heading for Organization XIII's stronghold. Though he was pretty vague about it, it sounded like Sora might be able to meet up with Riku if he tagged along, too. \r\nAccording to the King, the old mansion's computer was connected to the Twilight Town \"over there,\" where they should be able to find a way into the realm of darkness. \r\nThe computer was password-protected, but Sora and his friends remembered a likely hint: the ice cream that had been in the box with the photos of the mansion! \r\nTurns out the password was \"Sea-Salt Ice Cream.\" Entering the name of Ansem the Wise's favorite treat activated the device, which shot out a beam of light. The road to the other Twilight Town had been opened. \r\nSora and his friends arrived in the other Twilight Town and joined the King in his search for a way into the dark realm. \r\nThe entrance was an eerie gaping hole in the basement hall of the old mansion. \r\nSora and his friends headed into the darkness, but were beset by enemies on all sides. Axel was the one who got them out of their predicament. He apologized for kidnapping Kairi and put everything he had into wiping out the marauding foes. When Sora asked why, Axel muttered, \"I just wanted to see Roxas again. He made me feel like I had a heart,\" before fading away. Though it had cost him his life, Axel had used every last drop of his strength to open the final path Sora had to follow - the path that led to the kidnapped Kairi. \r\n",

        "Description": "Once again we came to Hollow Bastion. Things were different, but peace remained as far-off as ever. \r\nWhile wandering through a town still plagued by Heartless, we were reunited with Yuffie. \r\n\"Welcome to the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee!\" We were led to Merlin's house and found Leon and all our old friends there. Apparently they had all only recently remembered us. We agreed to help rebuild the town, but some big obstacles remained. \r\nIn Villain's Vale the Heartless were swarming, as Nobodies darted about. Sora was ready to take the entire horde on, but just then Organization XIII appeared, mocking Sora with puzzling words. But with no time to reflect on this, the Keyblade shone, opening the way to another world. Remembering Yen Sid's words, we set off once again. \r\nGuided by Merlin, we returned to Hollow Bastion. And what did he have? The Book of Pooh! \r\nBut the Heartless tore out the pages, and Pooh's memories with them. To put things back in order, we had no choice but to find all the torn pages. \r\nThorns had appeared in Disney Castle. If we didn't hurry, it would fall to the darkness. \r\nWith Merlin's assistance, we found out a way to save Disney Castle. \r\nThanks to Sora and his friends, peace returned to the castle once more. \r\nThe Heartless and Nobodies in Hollow Bastion continued to grow in number. \r\nUpon returning to Merlin's house, we learned of a computer Ansem used in his research. \r\nWhat's more, we found out the King was with Leon! \r\nBut when we got to Ansem's study, there was no King and no computer. \r\nThe door to the computer room was concealed by a hidden switch. \r\nHardly computer savvy, Sora and Donald pounded on the computer's keys, until a strange device activated and sucked us all into a strange world. \r\nThe world we found ourselves in was the computer system itself! With the help of a security program named Tron, we got back to the outside world and began looking for the password to a dataspace inside the computer. Inside that dataspace was all of Ansem's research data. \r\nBack in the outside world, we used scribbles on a blueprint (\"Door to Darkness\") and the King's own hints to figure out the password: the names of the Seven Princesses that were used to open that very door. \r\nWe headed back into the computer world to keep our promise to Tron. \r\nWe unlocked the dataspace and returned to Hollow Bastion. Now we could get the data inside the DTD. \r\nBut nearly all the data was corrupted, and no entries on Riku or Kairi were to be found. While poking around, we dug up someone's portrait. The King said it was Ansem, but he wasn't the Ansem we knew! The Ansem we knew was just the Heartless of someone who was pretending to be Ansem, and the Nobody of that same guy was the leader of Organization XIII. Whew! The King said he was searching for the real Ansem, who would know who the fake Ansem was. With all that said, the room lurched with a loud noise. \r\nOutside, the Heartless and Nobodies were swarming into the town. \r\nLeon and our other friends confronted the enemy horde. Everyone charged fearlessly into the sea of foes pouring from the valley's great maw. \r\nAnd who showed his face at the end? Xemnas, leader of Organization XIII. His true identity was Xehanort, pupil of Ansem the Wise. Sora tried to ask about Riku and Kairi, but Xemnas told him to \"ask your King\" and disappeared into the darkness. Then Axel appeared, warning Sora that the Organization was using him. Lost for answers, Sora was surrounded by Heartless -- and then a ray of light appeared... Amidst much speculation, the battle drew to a tentative close. \r\nHollow Bastion was supposed to be at peace... \r\nBut something was wrong. \r\nThe MCP hijacked the computer system and sent Heartless after Heartless into the town. \r\nWe headed off to see Tron again. \r\nThe source of the crisis was the MCP, which hoped to seize power. After destroying the MCP, we received a present from Tron. It was a picture of the town in its early days. Seeing the old sights brought back our friends' memories. When the name Hollow Bastion came into use, they did not know - but the town's true name was \"Radiant Garden.\" \r\n",

It seemed all he was interested in was his precious rose. \r\nWe asked Belle what was going on. \r\nBelle told us the Beast had been acting strange lately, and had locked up the servants in the dungeon. \r\nWe went to the west hall to rescue the servants and learn more. \r\nBut a wardrobe was blocking the door to the basement. \r\nWhen we tried to move the wardrobe, it talked! It was a human who had been magically transformed. When an enchantress turned the young master, a prince, into a beast because of his cruelty, she transformed all of his servants as well. \r\nWe defeated the marauding door and entered the dungeon, where we found the enchanted servants. \r\nHaving served the Beast for many years, they believed Heartless had caused the change in his demeanor. We stepped up to the plate at the first mention of Heartless. \r\nThe servants showed us to a secret passage. \r\nWe opened the hidden door and headed for the Beast's room. \r\nInside was Xaldin from Organization XIII, stoking the flames of the Beast's anger. Enraged, the Beast set upon us, but he recovered his senses with the servants' help. The Beast worried that he had done something terrible to Belle while his mind was not his own. \r\nWanting to talk to Belle, the Beast went in search of her, but she was nowhere to be found. \r\nJust then, her voice came from the ballroom, calling for help! \r\nWe fought the Heartless that had come after Belle. She was unharmed, although Xaldin escaped. The Beast apologized for his behavior and the two became closer than ever. Still, it may be some time before the spell is broken. \r\nPeace had returned to the Beast's castle - for now... \r\nWe visited the castle again. The Beast was restless and ill at ease. \r\nIt was a special day indeed, when he would enjoy an elegant dance with Belle. As the dance was beginning, however, Xaldin appeared and said he had taken that which the Beast held \"very dear.\" \r\nXaldin had taken the Beast's precious rose. Brokenhearted, the Beast tried to send Belle and us out of the castle. The rose was the key to breaking the spell cast on the Beast and his servants; it was their only hope. \r\nBut there was no time to mope. \"Don't throw away your last chance,\" encouraged Sora. The Beast found the strength to fight again. \r\nThe fearless Xaldin looked down upon the revitalized Beast. \"When Kingdom Hearts is ours, we can exist fully and completely.\" \r\nXaldin tried to kidnap Belle as a way of trapping the Beast, but she fought back. We seized that moment to defeat Xaldin. The rose was returned safely, and the Beast realized what was truly dear to him. Their dance began. The spell will surely be broken any day now... \r\n",

        "Description": "We arrived a short distance from the Coliseum and spotted Heartless closing in on a woman. \r\nIt turned out to be Hercules' friend Megara, who was on her way to ask Hades to give Herc some time off. We were worried for her safety, so we headed for the Underworld in her place. \r\nMeanwhile, Hades was trying to make the warrior Auron, who had been summoned from the Underworld, go up against Hercules. Auron refused. We arrived in time to help Auron fight Hades, but the curse of the Underworld sapped our strength. \r\nAfter a bitter struggle, we managed to contain Cerberus and escape the Underworld. At the same time, Hades was looking for a way to use Sora's Keyblade to unlock the Underworld's coliseum. \r\nWe met up with Hercules at the Coliseum. When we told him we wanted to \"teach Hades a thing or two,\" Herc offered to get us the Olympus Stone, which keeps its bearer safe from the power of the Underworld. \r\nWhile Hercules was away, we trained hard under Phil's watchful eye. \r\nWhen Herc returned, it was with a heavy heart. \r\nThe Olympus Stone had been stolen by someone dressed in black. Just then, Hades arrived to say he'd dragged Meg down into the Underworld. Herc wanted to go save her right away, but he had a match with the Hydra to worry about. \r\nPhil, too, was attacked by someone in black. We were the only ones who could unravel this mystery. \r\nStill suffering from the Underworld's curse, we made our way deeper into Hades' lair. \r\nWe found and defeated a member of Organization XIII and won back the Olympus Stone. \r\nThe curse could no longer touch us. Sora discovered a suspicious lock deep within the Underworld and unlocked it with the Keyblade. \r\nThat's where Meg was! But why did Hades look so happy as he left the scene? Hercules caught up to the party and distracted the enemy so we could take Meg back up to the surface. Meg, however, was worried about Herc. \r\nWe went back to lend a hand and take down Pete, who had been working for Hades. Hades left the party with these chilling words: \"Maybe you should go check on that Hydra...\" \r\nHercules was sure he'd defeated the Hydra, but it had revived somehow - and now the Coliseum was in ruins. Though we managed to get rid of the beast for good, Herc lost his will to fight. We were concerned, but all we could do was trust Meg to take good care of him. \r\nSomething huge and mysterious had appeared at the Underworld entrance. \r\nThe Underdrome that Zeus had locked up had apparently been unlocked and put back in business. \r\nAll of us, including Hercules, were forced to participate in the Hades Cup. \r\nIf we made it all the way to the finals, we would have to face Auron. Hercules was still down on himself, but kept moving up the ranks. \r\nThe final challengers were decided! But what was wrong with Auron? He was acting strange. \r\nHades, the big baddie we'd all been after, had been controlling Auron with a magical statue. \r\nIf we could find that statue, Auron's will would be his own again. We headed for the Underworld as Herc's clash with Auron commenced. \r\nWe finally found the statue, which contained remnants of Auron's difficult past. His heart was strengthened by the very suffering he had had to endure. \r\nWe recovered Auron's heart, and Herc's feelings for Meg restored his strength as well. We all worked together to defeat Hades once and for all, and our heroism was commemorated in a constellation that will shine brightly in the night sky forevermore. \r\n",

He swore he was a new bird, and so we took him along to the palace to see Aladdin. \r\nWe found Jasmine, who was surprised and upset to see Iago. She must've suspected he was up to no good. Walking into town, we heard a peddler shout \"Stop, thief!\" He was chasing after Abu and Aladdin. It looks like Abu had swiped a lamp from the peddler. Aladdin returned it to its rightful owner... but that was the lamp with Jafar in it! \r\nWe couldn't let things stand like that, so we tried to get the peddler to give us the lamp. However, his asking price was a treasure fit for a sultan. We couldn't just go looting the palace to buy a measly lamp, though. Iago pointed out that there might be an appropriate treasure in the Cave of Wonders. \r\nWe arrived at the Cave of Wonders, former home of the magic lamp, in search of treasure. \r\nWe disarmed the traps set within the Cave and moved further in. \r\nAt long last, a staircase appeared before us. \r\nWe opened the door. \r\nJust beyond it was a room filled with treasure! We chose a suitable prize and returned to Agrabah, but the peddler's shop was empty. \r\nThe peddler was being pursued by Pete, who wanted the magic lamp. \r\nPete conjured up some Heartless to nab the lamp, but they were no match for us. The lamp was sealed away, deep inside the palace. Maybe Iago really had gone straight after all... \r\nThings should have been back to normal in Agrabah... \r\nJafar had returned - the peddler let him out of the magic lamp! Iago said he was in the desert ruins. \r\nIago led us to an oasis. A sandstorm blocked our way, but Genie's magic helped us get through and continue toward the ruins. \r\nBut Jafar was nowhere to be found. In fact, Iago had tricked us into going to the ruins. It was a scheme of Jafar's to get them away from the palace! \r\nWe rushed back to the palace and put an end to Jafar's evil ambitions.

Sora met Mulan, and learned that Mushu is a guardian dragon for her family. She was pretending to be a man so she could join the Imperial Army and face the Huns. \r\nMulan attempted to join the army under the name Ping, but she was turned away. Sora proposed a way for Ping to prove himself: he must complete the captain's assignments as a test of his worth. \r\nPing worked hard on his assignments and grew ever stronger. \r\nAlthough Ping was allowed to join the army, he still wasn't recognized as much of a soldier. That's when Mushu spotted Shan-Yu walking into a cave. Ping would be a hero if he could defeat the mighty Hun leader. \r\nWe helped Ping search the cave for Shan-Yu, but he was gone. We cleared out a swarm of Heartless who had appeared in the cave instead. \r\nWhen we returned to camp to tell the captain of Ping's heroic deed, we found both the village and the troops had been decimated by Shan-Yu's army. \r\nWe faced off against the enemy army at the mountain peak. Ping devised an ace strategy for defeating both Shan-Yu and his Heartless hordes, but she was revealed to be a woman and expelled from the army. \r\nMulan was ready to give up and go back home. Then she spotted Shan-Yu, who she thought had been defeated, heading for the Imperial City. \r\nThe Emperor was in real trouble! \r\nWe arrived just in time to defeat Shan-Yu and keep the Emperor safe. Mulan was praised by both the Emperor and the Captain as China's bravest woman. \r\nPeace reigned in the Land of Dragons... or did it? \r\nWe stopped by the village again and spotted someone dressed all in black. \r\nMulan joined us as we pursued the man to the mountain's peak. \r\nSora felt something as he came face to face with the man. Could it be Riku? He ran away before Sora could find out. A giant Heartless showed up instead, and it was headed for the Imperial City! \r\nWe ran toward the Imperial City, but everything was fine. A black-cloaked man had been spotted nearby. \r\nWe hurried to the palace. \r\nThe doors were shut tight, but Mulan's quick thinking got us inside, where we found the man in black... \r\n\"Riku?\" The man revealed his identity after Sora called out to him. It was Xigbar from Organization XIII. We held off the enemies Xigbar sent after us. \r\nWe went to make sure the Emperor and the Captain were safe. They both said they had met a black-cloaked man earlier - and it wasn't Xigbar. Was it Riku? Just then a huge tremor shook the palace. \r\nThe giant Heartless we saw on the summit had arrived. We all worked together to defeat it and protect the Imperial City. Mulan's brave feats were recognized as she was asked to serve alongside the Captain. Sora was confident that Riku was all right. \r\n",

Sora got it back and went inside, only to find that Pooh's house was all that was left. \r\nSora was relieved to learn that Pooh was safe and sound. \r\nBut something was wrong. The pages the Heartless had torn out had affected Pooh's memory. He could hardly remember a thing. \r\nWhen Sora arrived with the torn page, a tree with a tiny door appeared. \r\nSora spotted Piglet being blown around by the wind. \r\nPiglet was finally rescued, but was so stunned that Pooh had forgotten him that he was carried off by the wind yet again. \r\nSora tried to help Piglet, who had to jump down from a high perch. This courageous act jogged Pooh's memory a little: he remembered Piglet, but still didn't recognize Sora. \r\nWhen Sora arrived with the torn page, a tree surrounded by a garden appeared. \r\nPooh didn't remember Eeyore, either. The donkey suspected Pooh's memory would improve with a full stomach, so he led him to a stash of honey. \r\nBut the honey didn't seem to help Pooh remember a thing. Rabbit, whose honey Pooh was eating, thought the bear might need even more of the sweet and gooey treat. \r\nThat didn't help, either. Watching Rabbit rack his brain, Pooh remembered both Rabbit and Eeyore, although Sora was still a stranger to him. \r\nWhen Sora arrived with the torn page, a tree full of packages appeared. \r\nWorried about Pooh, Kanga and Roo brought over some medicine for him, but Tigger bounced away with it. \r\nTigger suggested that Pooh's memory might return if everyone bounced together. \r\nBut Pooh's mind remained as blank as ever. Seeing the downhearted Tigger brought back Pooh's memories of the rest of his friends. Then, in a dream, Pooh seemed about to remember something else... \r\nWhen Sora arrived with the torn page, a spooky-looking cave appeared. \r\nIt looked like Pooh had gone into the cave all by himself. \r\nHe had been looking for someone who'd made him a very special promise. That turned out to be Sora. Pooh and Sora took each other's hand and headed back happy, surrounded by their friends. \r\nWhen Sora arrived with the torn page, a hill surrounded by a starry sky appeared. \r\nPooh had gotten his head stuck in a honey pot. Silly bear! \r\nPooh was looking for a way to keep Sora from leaving. \"What should I do so you won't go far away?\" he asked. Sora pointed to Pooh's heart and told him he'll always be right there. \r\n",

She told us about the sad state of her homeland, and Sora agreed to help make things right. \r\nBut according to the prophet, Rafiki, whoever saved the Pride Lands would be king. Sora just wasn't qualified. \r\nAs we started to leave the Pride Lands, we were surrounded by King Scar and his hyena henchmen, but Nala helped us escape. When Sora asked her if there was anyone else who could be king, she muttered, \"If only Simba were here...\" \r\nSimba had fought alongside Sora a year earlier. Nala was thrilled to hear this news! \r\nScar had told Nala that Simba had died along with Mufasa, their last king. Just then, Rafiki appeared and pointed toward the oasis. \r\nThat's where Simba was. \r\nNala asked him to come back to the Pride Lands, but Simba declined, saying it was better to forget the past and live for today - \"hakuna matata.\" \r\nSimba had been blaming himself for his father's death when he saw a vision of his father, who gave him the courage to return to the Pride Lands. \r\nSimba challenged Scar to a fight, during which he learned the truth: Scar had killed his father Mufasa. Simba roared with anger! \r\nSimba defeated Scar and let out a roar of triumph from the Pride Rock overlook. The lionesses responded to his call as their new king ascended to his throne. \r\nSimba is king of the Pride Lands. \r\nWe met up with the hyenas on the savannah. They could only laugh at the very mention of Simba, the new king. Thinking this was strange, we set off to see Simba when Scar's ghost appeared. \r\nAlthough this may have been a sign that the kingdom was in decline, Simba seemed unwilling to take any action. His choice caused great unease among his subjects. \r\nBut Simba had a reason for his inability to act - he was tied up in thinking \"What would my father have done?\" We helped him realize that his own decisions were more important, and Simba regained his confidence as a leader. \r\nAccording to Rafiki, Scar's ghost was a manifestation of Simba's weakness. \r\nWe headed for the elephant graveyard to learn just what the mystic mandrill meant by these words. We asked the hyenas about Scar's ghost, who suddenly reappeared. Simba ran away. \r\nWe gave Simba some much-needed encouragement, and he in turn realized how his many friends were there for him. Simba defeated Scar's ghost at last. \r\nSimba rescued Nala from the hands of a giant Heartless, and peace reigned over the Pride Lands once again. \r\n",

We went after them along with a young man named Will. \r\nBut the pirates had already set sail. We managed to persuade Jack Sparrow, a lone pirate we met at the harbor, to take the Royal Navy's Interceptor and go after the pirate's ship, the Black Pearl. \r\nMeanwhile Barbossa was divulging his secret: because they stole certain Aztec medallions, he and his crew were put under a horrible curse. To break the curse, all the medallions must be restored to their chest and the blood repaid... \r\nIt turned out the Black Pearl was Jack's boat, which Barbossa had stolen. The reason Jack helped us was so he could get his boat back. With compass in hand, Jack guided the Interceptor across the seas... We arrived at Isla de la Muerta, the resting place for the cursed gold. We were told to watch the boat while Will and Jack set off to rescue Elizabeth, but when no one returned, we started to worry. Inside the island cave, the raucous pirates stood before all the medallions they had finally tracked down. Now the blood could be repaid, and the curse broken... \r\n...except that Elizabeth's blood had no effect at all. While the pirates bickered over their plight, Will escaped with Elizabeth. \r\nThe truth came to light on the way back to Port Royal. The key to breaking the curse wasn't Elizabeth's blood, but that of Will's father - the blood of a pirate. The blood to be repaid ran in Will's veins. The scheming Barbossa tracked down the Interceptor, kidnapping Will and rigging the ship with gunpowder. \r\nAll of us, including Jack, were in a real pinch, but together we overcame the crisis and set off to rescue Will. \r\nOur battle with Barbossa ended in victory, and thanks to Jack himself being cursed, no less! Will and Elizabeth were elated to be together again, and Jack set sail on the Pearl once more. \r\nThe town looked peaceful - but was it? \r\nOur return to Port Royal was once again met with some sort of fuss down at the harbor. \r\nThe curse was supposed to be lifted, but sure enough, undead pirates were the source of the ruckus. With Jack's help we put them in line, and then Elizabeth showed up. Will, thinking the medallions might be the source of the problem, set off for Isla de Muerta. \r\nWe went out to sea per Elizabeth's wishes, and found Will drifting on a shipwreck. He said Organization XIII took the medallions. \r\nJack wanted nothing to do with it, but then a member of the Organization showed up. He invoked \"parley\" from the Pirates' Code and made off with several of the gold medallions. In all the fuss we were attacked by a monster, and the Interceptor was sunk. \r\nWe washed up in a ship graveyard. For some reason, Jack alone had fallen under the monster's curse. \r\n\"They're making pirates look like proper gents,\" said Jack, as we set off after the Organization and the gold. The final battle was to be in Port Royal. \r\nWe defeated the monster and removed Jack's curse. The Organization got away, but Port Royal would be at peace once the Aztec gold was at the bottom of the sea.

Unaware of Sally's feeling of dread, Jack set off to see Santa Claus. \r\nJust then, Heartless appeared in town. \"How is Santa supposed to relax with all this going on?\" Jack fretted, and asked us to be Santa's bodyguards. \r\nSanta lived in Christmas Town, where a colorful scene unfolded before us as we walked through the gates. \r\nBut there were Heartless here, too. We fought as one and made our way to Santa's house. \r\nWe were happy to see that Santa was safe and sound when a loud noise came from a back room. \r\nLock, Shock, and Barrel were spotted running out of the toy workshop. \r\nWe followed the trio's footsteps back to Halloween Town and found the three pranksters, who said Oogie had returned - just before running away. It was then that the party learned that Maleficent had brought Oogie back to life! Sally's intuition had been right on. The newly revived Oogie kidnapped Santa! \r\nWe hurried back to Christmas Town in pursuit of Oogie. \r\nOogie was trying to take over the toy workshop, but we defeated him handily. With that taken care of, Jack told Santa that he'd like to deliver the presents this time. Santa reminded Jack that he had his own special role to play, so Jack returned to his post as the Pumpkin King. \r\nChristmas was right around the corner. \r\nWe stopped by Halloween Town and found presents scattered all over the place. We returned them to Santa, who said they had been stolen. We were about to set out with Jack to find the culprit when we heard a noise come from the toy workshop. \r\nWe went into the workshop, where we found Lock, Shock, and Barrel, who said they were only looking for parts for the doctor's experiment. Sally arrived and said that Heartless had appeared in the town square. Could they have been responsible? \r\nThe Heartless didn't steal any presents. And now the doctor's experiment had been stolen, too. Who on earth could the thief be? We would have to lure them in somehow. We borrowed Santa's workshop to make decoy presents. \r\nWe used these presents to set a trap for the thief. \r\nThe plan was a great success! We caught the thief right away - and it turned out to be the doctor's experiment. It had been searching for a heart of its own in all the wrapped presents. As the snow fell, Jack received a precious gift from Sally, who shared her feelings with him. \r\n",

Caught by Commander Sark, we were sent to a pit cell, where we met Tron, a security program. \r\nWith Tron's help, we broke out of the cell and headed for the energy core in the canyon. \r\nWe needed it to restore power to the terminal leading back to the outside world. \r\nWith everything for our return journey in order, Tron asked us a favor. \r\nTo gain access to the dataspace known as the DTD, we needed to find Tron's user and ask him the password. And the User? None other than Ansem. \r\nBack in the outside world, we used scribbles on a blueprint (\"Door to Darkness\") and the King's own hints to figure out the password: the names of the Seven Princesses that were used to open that very door. \r\nTron tried the password right away, unlocking the dataspace, but the MCP sent a hostile program, putting the town itself in danger. \r\nWe hurried to the I/O tower, but the program remained undisrupted. \r\nBy destroying the hostile program, we were able to save the town. \r\nAfter the battle, Tron told us more about Ansem. Both Tron and the MCP were improved by Ansem, but why would the same person restore two opposing programs? The mysteries remained, but we figured we'd find the answer eventually. Having gained a special connection to Tron, we returned to the outside world. \r\nThings should have calmed down in the computer world... \r\nThe town was facing a crisis because of the MCP, so we headed back into the computer world. \r\nIt seemed the MCP was ready to wage all-out war against the Users. Reunited with Tron, we went to download a program designed to destroy the MCP for good. \r\nLeon was doing his part in the outside world, too. \r\nAt the I/O tower, we downloaded the program, powering up Tron and getting us access to a solar sailer in the process. \r\nThe final battle was at hand... We boarded the solar sailer and headed for the MCP's mesa. \r\nWe defeated Sark, and thwarted the MCP's plans to conquer all. We made a promise with Tron to meet again and parted ways. Tron used his control of the system to send us a gift: a view of the town in its early days. \r\n",

        "Description": "Axel used the last of his strength to help us escape the darkness. We then found ourselves in a town bathed in eerie moonlight. It seemed Kairi was being held in the dungeon of this town's castle. \r\nWe were on our way to the castle when a man in a black coat blocked our path. He was wielding a Keyblade and bragging about how he'd defeated Riku... but Sora was the only one who saw him. \"Tell me. Tell me why he picked you!\" he said,and after losing his battle with Sora, disappeared - looking somehow satisfied. \r\nOrganization XIII's Saïx was waiting for us in the pitch-black castle, and pointed at the moon in the night sky. But that was no moon - it was Kingdom Hearts, and it must have absorbed countless hearts to grow to that size. \"The Organization doesn't need you anymore,\" Saïx scoffed, and summoned masses of Heartless to do Sora in. \r\nThat's when we heard an old familiar voice: Kairi! But there was no time to celebrate, as the enemies kept coming in droves. Kairi stepped in to end the battle and rescue Sora. The one who had lent a hand to Kairi was the false Ansem: Xehanort, apprentice to Ansem the Wise. Sora was at a loss... and then there was the fact that Organization XIII's Xigbar called him Roxas. Defeating Xigbar, however, brought Sora no closer to the truth. \r\nSora finally pushed through the throngs of Heartless and made his way to Kairi. Watching over the two as they embraced in joyous reunion was Xehanort's Heartless - Riku. DiZ, who had observed the battle, told the King his true identity. DiZ was the real Ansem the Wise, and his apprentice Xehanort's Nobody was Xemnas, leader of Organization XIII. We had already defeated Xehanort's Heartless in battle once before, when he went by the name \"Ansem, Seeker of Darkness.\" After his defeat, however, he latched on to Riku's heart and began drawing him into the darkness. Though Riku didn't give in to the darkness, he needed to use its power. \"Riku chose that form so he could harness the power of darkness.\" Everyone agreed with Sora: \"You're still Riku, no matter what!\" If the battle was what was keeping the power of darkness around, it was time to finish that fight once and for all. \r\nAfter taking on Luxord and Saïx, we learned the truth about Roxas. \"Roxas... is your Nobody, Sora.\" Roxas had been taken in by Xemnas and made a member of Organization XIII, but, wanting to meet Sora, had seemingly abandoned the shady group. \"I wish I could've met him too,\" muttered Sora; Riku pointed to Sora's heart, indicating that Roxas was within. Meanwhile, the King and Ansem the Wise were using a device to try to stop Kingdom Hearts, but it began to malfunction. It seemed no one could contain the power of hearts within the massive Kingdom Hearts... Once Ansem realized the truth about the human heart, he decided to listen to what his own heart was telling him. He accepted his fate at the hands of the device, which had run amok and was going to explode. The explosion scattered the hearts that had amassed within Kingdom Hearts, raining them down on us all. When the \"heartshower\" had lifted, Riku had regained his true form. \r\nMaleficent and Pete opened the path to the final battle. They, too, had chosen to do what their hearts commanded, and no one could interfere with their resolve. We joined together to battle Xemnas. When we cornered him, he extracted the power of Kingdom Hearts and vanished. The worlds would be in great danger if we just let him escape! A door appeared in a brilliant flash of light, just waiting for us. \"The worlds opened this path for us. Looks like they're dependin' on us to make sure they stay safe.\" With strong hearts, we went on to fight our final battle, our dear friends by our side. \r\n",

Sora agreed to help Jiminy find Pinocchio before that could happen. \r\nBut by the time they rescued Pinocchio from some Nightmares, he had sprouted donkey ears and a tail. Jiminy and Pinocchio escaped while Sora faced off against more Nightmares. \r\nAfter eliminating the threat, Sora came face-to-face with the grey-haired youth and Xemnas, who accused Sora of being the same as the Nobodies. Once again, they vanished without further explanation. \r\nThe Blue Fairy found Sora and told him that Pinocchio and Jiminy had gone to the bottom of the sea to rescue Geppetto, who had been swallowed by Monstro the whale. \r\nSora got there just in time to witness Pinocchio and Jiminy getting gobbled up too. Then a giant Nightmare appeared and froze Monstro solid. \r\nSora defeated the Nightmare, and having been freed of the ice, Monstro let out a mighty sneeze. \r\nRemembering that this world would soon be swallowed by darkness, Sora unlocked the Sleeping Keyhole. \r\n",

Sora escaped but was ambushed by Rinzler, who mysteriously vanished without a fight. \r\nFlynn, Sam, and Quorra watched all this unfold; intrigued, Quorra approached Sora. As it turned out, Rinzler was really Sora's friend Tron, whose memory had been manipulated. Sora wanted to set Tron's memory straight, so Quorra agreed to take him to CLU, who might still possess Tron's original source code. \r\nWhile searching for the source code on the Throneship, Sora and Quorra were attacked by Rinzler. Quorra was overwhelmed, but before Sora could intervene, the Throneship hatch closed and she was left behind. \r\nThe grey-haired youth appeared along with Xemnas, who posed a difficult question: how could Sora be sure his memories and feelings were his to begin with? Then the grey-haired youth implied that this \"dream world\" was not a dream at all... Both vanished after saying their piece. \r\nSora was taken to the stadium, where he came face-to-face with CLU and Rinzler. CLU offered to restore Tron's memory in exchange for the Keyblade, but Sora had to refuse, leading to a battle with Rinzler. Sora did not want to fight his friend, but when Quorra arrived, safe and sound, and told him to use the Keyblade, he realized he might still be able to bring Tron to his senses. \r\nWith Rinzler's defeat, Sora became distracted. Seeing his chance, CLU hurled his disc---but Rinzler pushed Sora out of harm's way right in the nick of time. The disc caused Rinzler's footing to derez, and while he tried to grab for Sora's hand, he plunged into the abyss. \r\nRealizing some part of his friend inside Rinzler had reached for his hand, Sora struck upon the answer to Xemnas's question. We know we are real because our hearts lead us back to the truth. He unlocked the Sleeping Keyhole. \r\n",

With Xehanort's return drawing ever closer, the sorcerer was forced to take drastic measures, and so he agreed to Lea's request. \r\nKing Mickey and the others were now very worried about Sora and Riku, but Yen Sid insisted that the two were still out of Xehanort's reach. After discussing various possibilities, the king stumbled upon the truth: having given up his body, Xehanort was taking advantage of the period of time when a version of him had possessed Riku. He had been manipulating events all along. The king set off to rescue Sora and Riku. \r\n*** \r\nAfter unlocking the seven Sleeping Keyholes, Sora found himself in the same world where Organization XIII had once held its stronghold. None of it made any sense... \r\nXigbar appeared and revealed that Sora had been lured here, before plunging him into a deep sleep. \r\n*** \r\nThe grey-haired youth explained that it had all begun when he was approached by a man in a brown robe: Ansem. Later, when the Destiny Islands were about to be swallowed by darkness, that same Ansem possessed Riku. \r\nTraverse Town- Sora had been here many times before. He saw King Mickey and the others run by; when Sora chased after them, he found Naminé around the corner---except it was not Naminé at all, but some other girl in a black coat. Tears formed on Sora's cheeks for reasons he could not understand. Before he could reach the girl, his vision blurred. \r\nHe spotted someone in a black coat and called out to the figure, but this time it turned out to be Roxas. Roxas took Sora's hand, and all the hurt he had suffered lanced through Sora's memory. \r\nNext Sora saw Riku and Kairi---except they weren't Riku and Kairi; they were two strangers. They seemed kind, but called him \"Ven.\" Sora no longer looked like himself. He reached out to take the strangers' hands---but now they were Riku and Kairi again, and they were leaving him behind. He tried to catch them, but his legs were heavy; he could barely move. \r\nAfter a blinding flash, Sora found himself in his own past, when he was still little. Then the vision swooped away, as though he were being dragged out of it. \r\n*** \r\nHad those all been illusions? They were dreams, explained Xigbar. He and Xemnas went on to reveal other surprises- that Nobodies could have hearts after all, and that the Organization had been established for a greater purpose. Though shaken, Sora put his faith in the Keyblade and stood strong. \r\nThe grey-haired youth pointed to the sigil on Sora's chest, which had allowed them to keep tabs on him. Sora, he explained, was destined to be the thirteenth \"vessel\" they needed. \r\nSora called Riku's name as he sank into the dark abyss. \r\nA single ray of light chased him down, down, down... Right before the darkness enveloped him completely, an aura of light appeared and clad him in armor. Thus protected, his body reclined in the darkness's embrace. \r\n",

        "Description": "Now that Queen Minnie was safe, King Mickey and friends returned to Yen Sid's Tower with a guest. Lea seemed to want something from Yen Sid. With Xehanort's return drawing ever closer, the sorcerer was forced to take drastic measures, and so he agreed to Lea's request. \r\nKing Mickey and the others were now very worried about Sora and Riku, but Yen Sid insisted that the two were still out of Xehanort's reach. After discussing various possibilities, the king stumbled upon the truth: having given up his body, Xehanort was taking advantage of the period of time when a version of him had possessed Riku. He had been manipulating events all along. The king set off to rescue Sora and Riku. \r\n*** \r\nAfter unlocking the seven Sleeping Keyholes, Riku found himself in the same world where Organization XIII had once held its stronghold. \r\nRiku found a spectral version of Sora trapped inside some sort of bubble. He tried to wake his friend, but a personification of Sora's nightmares, a figure in a black coat, approached from behind. \r\nHe defeated the Nightmare and kept calling to Sora, but it was Ansem who responded and dragged Riku into the darkness for a final confrontation. \r\nAnsem explained that Riku had unknowingly dove into Sora's dreams and become a Dream Eater, but he would be of no help to his friend so long as he kept the darkness inside him in check. Riku agreed---but rather than give in to Ansem and accept the darkness, Riku decided to return it to light once and for all. He drew his Keyblade. \r\nAfter Ansem was defeated, Riku awoke in the real world, but his Dream Eater powers remained. With the help of some Spirits, he was able to reach Sora. \r\nSora was seated on one of the Organization's thirteen thrones, but the grey- haired youth knocked Riku away before he could get to his friend. The youth revealed that Organization XIII's true purpose was to transfer the heart of Xehanort into thirteen worthy \"vessels.\" Now Sora was about to become the last of those vessels. \r\nAs if to drive this point home, twelve other figures materialized and filled the other seats. The youth revealed his identity: he was Xehanort's boyhood form. Just as he was gesturing to the highest seat of them all, King Mickey appeared and stopped time. He tried to rescue Sora, but someone lashed out at the king and knocked him away. Young Xehanort was able to move even when time was stopped! He and Riku fought. \r\nNo sooner had Riku bested the youth than time started to flow again, and Master Xehanort appeared in the highest seat. He told Riku and King Mickey about the \"seven guardians of light\" and \"thirteen seekers of darkness\" who were destined to clash and forge the X-blade. They were too late; Master Xehanort's heart was snaking its way toward Sora, and Xemnas and Ansem were barring the way... \r\nJust then, a blaze of fire stopped Xehanort's heart from reaching Sora. Lea had arrived right in the nick of time! The king and Riku were so shocked that they nearly forgot they were in danger, but Donald and Goofy arrived in a flash of light to save the day. \r\nMaster Xehanort had failed to claim Sora, but he assured all present that the clash between light and darkness was imminent. Then he and the other twelve members of the real Organization XIII dematerialized and returned whence they came. \r\n",

And even if that person reached the abyss into which Sora's heart had fallen, they might never return from the darkness. But Riku had heard Sora calling to him, and knew he must be the one to make the dive back into Sora's slumber. \r\n*** \r\nIn the abyss, Riku was attacked by a suit of armor clad in deepest darkness. He defeated the armor and freed Sora from its defenses, then watched helplessly as his friend sank into the darkness. Did he do the right thing? Only Sora's Keyblade remained. Riku took it and unlocked the Keyhole. \r\nRiku's eyes blinked open. He was home, on their island. Figures appeared asking difficult questions: Roxas; another boy who looked like Roxas; a girl with raven hair. He sensed his answers mattered. When his eyes next blinked open, he found himself in the company of Ansem the Wise. \r\nAnsem the Wise gave Riku his research data, which he hoped would serve as a clue when Sora or those connected to him were most lost. The love in Sora's heart would be the only way to save them. With that, the true Ansem assured Riku that Sora had awoken. It was time to go home. \r\n*** \r\nRiku woke from his dive to hear what sounded like a celebration; were Sora, Donald, and Goofy having...a party? Sora threw his arms around Riku when he saw his friend was safe. Somehow, it all seemed very backwards. \r\nRiku passed the exam. He had shown the Mark of Mastery, and so Yen Sid dubbed him a true Keyblade Master. Sora was happy to see his best friend receive such an honor. Lea, however, was still trying to get the knack of summoning his own Keyblade. \r\nHis...what? As if that weren't enough of a shock, suddenly a Keyblade materialized in Lea's hand. He had become a Keyblade wielder! \r\nSora realized he had unfinished business. He opened the Sleeping Keyhole and ventured through alone. When he woke up in Traverse Town, he looked around for... \r\nThere they were! A moment later, Sora was surrounded by rowdy, but very happy Spirits.

        "Description": "Freshly revived and flanked by a new Organization XIII, Master Xehanort has set his plans in motion. By staging a clash between seven guardians of light and the Organization's thirteen seekers of darkness, he intends to forge a weapon called the \"χ-blade\" and plunge the worlds into shadow once more. We need to find seven guardians of light and meet his challenge. If we don't face him, Xehanort will target seven innocent hearts instead. \r\nKing Mickey's mentor, Master Yen Sid, believes the first step is to find three lost Keyblade wielders who vanished over a decade ago: Aqua, Ventus, and Terra. Any or all of them could be potential guardians of light. \r\nIn the meantime, Sora needs to free Roxas's heart, which is sleeping inside his own. To do so, he'll need the \"power of waking.\" \r\nAnd so it was that Master Yen Sid sent Sora, Donald, and Goofy on a new journey to try and find that power. \r\nEverybody returned to Master Yen Sid's tower to share information. Sora was given some brand-new vestments to wear, and I joined the team to chronicle the adventure. (Jiminy Cricket, at your service!) \r\nWhile we were away, Riku and King Mickey had been exploring the realm of darkness in search of Aqua, but they ran into a powerful swarm of Heartless. Both their Keyblades were rendered useless in the struggle, and they were forced to retreat to the tower. \r\nSora pointed out that we have no vessel to put Roxas's heart in and make him whole. Riku told him about the replicas created by Organization XIII. Maybe one of those would work, since they change appearance to reflect the heart that's put in them. That gave us all a little hope as we pressed on to the next world. \r\nSora knew that Organization XIII turning up in all the worlds we were visiting couldn't possibly be a good sign, but he was distracted by a call from Ienzo in Radiant Garden. \r\nIenzo and his team had deciphered some of Ansem the Wise's data, and it had revealed that Sora's heart was home to not one, not two, but three other unique hearts. The first was Roxas, and the second we now suspected was Ventus. Who was the third? With yet another new mystery to solve, we continued our journey. \r\nWe reported back to Master Yen Sid, Riku, and King Mickey, and learned that the \"New Seven Hearts\" Organization XIII were looking for must be seven hearts of pure light who inherited the powers of the seven princesses. \r\nSora knew we'd have to speed things up to keep Rapunzel, Elsa, Anna, and Kairi safe. He volunteered to head to the realm of darkness to keep looking for Aqua, but Riku convinced him to focus on acquiring the power of waking instead. \r\nAt last, we had our seven guardians. Joining Sora, Riku, and the King were Axel and Kairi—fresh back from their training with Merlin—and two of the missing Keyblade wielders, Aqua and Ventus. We all renewed our vows to rescue Roxas, Naminé, and Terra, who still remained out of reach. \r\nThe seven guardians (plus Donald and Goofy, which made nine) prepared for the journey to the battleground where they would face Organization XIII. \r\nWith our council adjourned, Sora returned to the Destiny Islands with Riku and Kairi. Kairi shared a paopu fruit with Sora, intertwining their destinies and making sure they remain a part of each other's lives, no matter what. \r\n",

Yet instead of the familiar Coliseum, he, Donald, and Goofy found themselves on a steep mountain trail. Perhaps less surprisingly, they ran into Hades, god of the Underworld, who released powerful Titans that blew our daring trio clear off the mountain. \r\nSora, Donald, and Goofy landed in Thebes, where they literally dropped in on just the man they were looking for: the hero Hercules. However, their happy reunion was cut short when a pack of Heartless appeared and lit the city ablaze. With no time to waste, Herc and Sora split up to rescue any citizens still trapped in the fire. \r\nWhile searching the city, Sora and friends encountered a few less-than-Greek faces. Maleficent and Pete had come to Olympus in search of a black box, but paid little mind to Sora in his weakened state. More distressingly, Xigbar of Organization XIII seemed to suggest Sora's quest to gather hearts might do more harm than good. \r\nSora was unnerved, but saving the people of Thebes had to come first. \r\nJust when it seemed as though Thebes was out of danger, dark clouds began to swirl around Mount Olympus: a sign that after eighteen years of plotting, Hades had finally begun his coup. Herc raced ahead to the summit, worried for his father, Zeus, king of the gods. \r\nSora, Donald, and Goofy hurried after him. Up the mountain they went, sending the Rock Titan for a tumble along the way. Soon they reached the gods' abode and joined the battle for Olympus. \r\nHerc used his godlike strength to free his father, Zeus. A dash of immortal combat and a flash of divine lightning later, Hades and the Titans had been sent packing. \r\nSora never did get a clear answer about how to reclaim his lost strength, but Herc's off-the-cuff advice stuck with him. It's when we want to help people \"with all our heart\" that we're most likely to succeed—and that phrase would be Sora's beacon going forward. \r\n",

The new look didn't stop them from walloping the Heartless causing trouble, though. \r\nWoody, Buzz, and Andy's other toys saw the fight and introduced themselves. They reported that many of their friends had vanished, which was followed closely by the arrival of the Heartless and a hooded stranger in black. Immediately suspecting Organization XIII, we agreed to help the other toys search for clues at a nearby store called Galaxy Toys. \r\nNot long after arriving at Galaxy Toys, we had an unpleasant encounter with the Organization's Young Xehanort, who explained that he had separated Woody's group from Andy and the other toys by creating a second copy of their world. \r\nWorse yet, Young Xehanort seemed to have the power to possess the toys at the shop, which might explain why some of Woody's friends had disappeared. \r\nSora, Donald, and Goofy teamed up with Woody and Buzz to do battle with the possessed toys and rescue Rex, Hamm, and the Little Green Men. With all the toys out of danger, Sora was ready to go after Young Xehanort and put a stop to his scheme, but Buzz insisted that they had overstayed their welcome and needed to return home and wait for Andy. \r\nDespite being afraid of just about everything only moments ago, Rex was excited to find a likeness of Yozora, the video game character he'd mistaken Sora for. Buzz once again tried to convince the others to head home, but it was too late. Young Xehanort appeared and decided to advance his experiment to the next stage by taking control of Buzz and pitting him against his friends. \r\nSora managed to fight his way out of the trap Young Xehanort laid for him, and he, Woody, and the rest of us went to rescue Buzz. \r\nYoung Xehanort tried to shake us up by saying that friendship is just another reason to feel darkness and loneliness, but Woody knew different. Toy or not, even far apart, he could feel Andy's love filling his heart. Sora knew better too. There are hearts all around us, even in toys—and loneliness is just the heart's way of holding on and trying to reconnect. \r\nWe freed Buzz from Young Xehanort's control, and made a stand against the gigantic Heartless that appeared. \r\nDespite thwarting Young Xehanort's plans, we still weren't able to put the toys' world back to normal. Sora felt bad about it, but Woody pointed out the silver lining: if the world hadn't been split, none of us would have ever met each other. Happy to have made some new friends, we departed in high spirits—to infinity and beyond. \r\n",

The man introduced himself as Flynn Rider and asked Sora, Donald, and Goofy to deal with the threat. But by the time the dust had settled, Flynn Rider was gone. We searched the environs, and discovered a hidden passage that led to a tower just like something out of a painting. \r\nWe reached the base of the tower just in time to see Flynn descending it alongside Rapunzel, a girl with long, looong hair. She had never been outside the tower before, and her one wish was to travel to the Kingdom and watch the people of Corona send up the lanterns. Concerned about all the Heartless, Sora volunteered to help Flynn escort her there safely. \r\nWe made good progress, thanks in large part to Rapunzel's bravery, but when we scaled a hill and found a flower patch full of ferocious Nobodies, Sora urged his new friends to flee while he, Donald, and Goofy pruned the threats back. \r\nAfter the battle, the Organization's Marluxia appeared with an unexpected demand: that Sora protect Rapunzel, the precious light of this world. \r\nSomeone else had been looking for Rapunzel, too: Mother Gothel, who lived with Rapunzel in the tower. Sora was starting to fear for Rapunzel's safety, but perhaps he was worried about the wrong person. The royal guards' most tenacious steed, Maximus, seemed to have a bone to pick with Mr. Flynn Rider. \r\nRapunzel's gentle words convinced Maximus to be nice (or at least relatively nice) to Flynn until we all got to the Kingdom. It sure was a relief to be back together again, where we could look after each other. \r\nAfter a lively round of dancing in the bustling city square, we parted ways. Rapunzel and Flynn rowed out onto the lake, while the rest of us watched from the dock as the lanterns took flight. \r\nAlways there to ruin the moment, Marluxia and his Nobodies appeared and helped guide Rapunzel away from Flynn and back to Mother Gothel. Marluxia needed Rapunzel, one of the \"New Seven Hearts,\" to stay in the tower where she would be safe—and possibly useful to the Organization. \r\nSora grew furious at this revelation, but Marluxia used his powers to put him in a deep sleep before he could fight back. \r\nA slobbery tongue-bath from Maximus woke Sora from his slumber, where Flynn, Donald, and Goofy were waiting. Flynn raced ahead to the tower to free Rapunzel while the rest of us dealt with a seemingly endless supply of Nobodies. \r\nAt the tower, we watched as a cape fell from the window and spawned a powerful Heartless. It was a tough fight, but we prevailed. \r\nThings nearly ended badly for Eugene—turns out that's Flynn's real name—but Rapunzel saved his life with the magic in her tears. She was the lost princess we saw in the Kingdom's mosaic, whom Mother Gothel had taken as a baby. It was also Mother Gothel who had brought Rapunzel the tiara in an attempt to drive her and Eugene apart. \r\nKnowing Eugene and Rapunzel had found true love and would look after each other, we parted ways with them, stronger for our new friendships and ready to explore more worlds. \r\n",

When the decidedly less friendly Unversed appeared in the company lobby, we volunteered to play exterminator. \r\nGiven the circumstances, we all agreed that getting Boo home safely should be our top priority. Her house was connected to Sulley and Mike's company by a special door. \r\nBut our efforts to find it were cut short by sabotage: Randall, a former employee banished for his scheming, had returned and was eager to stage a comeback using the energy from negative emotions. Mike, Sulley, and the rest of us battled our way out of the factory with a little help from Boo's laugh energy. \r\nAlong our way back to the door vault, we faced power outages, explosions, fires, and other frustrations, but Sulley's quick thinking (and a little heavy lifting) helped us find a shortcut. \r\nOnce again we found ourselves face-to-face with Randall. Jealous of Sulley and Mike's success, he tried to use a huge Unversed to get us all out of the picture. Of course, since you're reading this, you know it didn't work. Sulley and Mike banished their rival from the factory again, and this time Sora used his Keyblade to lock the door behind Randall for good measure. \r\nJust as Sulley and Mike were about to send Boo home, the Organization's Vanitas appeared. He was the one who brought Randall back and furnished him with Unversed in order to gather negative emotions. \r\nVanitas revealed that Ventus, one of the missing Keyblade wielders, now sleeps inside of Sora, then attempted to rejoin with Ventus by force. Again, Sulley's quick thinking saved the day. With an imposing roar, he overpowered Vanitas and saved Sora from who knows what fate. \r\nWith our roller-coaster quest for Boo's door finally over, we said our good-byes to our little friend as she returned to her room. Next, it was time to bid Sulley and Mike farewell. We shared a few more laughs together, then said our thank-yous and got back to our usual business. \r\n",

We decided to go after her. \r\nAs she introduced herself as Queen Elsa of Arendelle, we were suddenly ambushed by more Heartless. Elsa wiped one of them out with a magical blast of ice. It was that power—and the possibility that she might hurt someone with it—that had convinced Elsa she must leave her kingdom behind. She ran from us, asking to be left alone, but her sadness and selflessness struck a chord with Sora. \r\nIt was then that a member of Organization XIII going by Larxene appeared and tried to trap us in a winding, wintry maze. We escaped and followed Elsa's trail up the North Mountain, where we watched in awe as she constructed a magnificent palace of ice. But again, Larxene prevented us from speaking with Elsa. It turned out the Organization had been observing Elsa to see if she might be one of the New Seven Hearts. Before we knew it, Larxene had flung us back down the \r\nslopes, where we soon found ourselves caught in a massive avalanche. \r\nSoon after digging ourselves out of the snow, we made some new friends: a walking, talking snowman named Olaf; Elsa's younger sister, Anna; Kristoff, her guide; and Sven, Kristoff's reindeer companion. \r\nAnna had come up the mountain to find Elsa and put an end to the unnatural winter affecting Arendelle. She told Sora about her childhood, and how she and her sister grew apart. Elsa's choice to live in solitude to protect her sister reminded Sora of Riku's actions in the past. \r\nWhen a pack of Heartless attacked, we told Anna and her friends to hurry on to Elsa's palace while we handled the threat. \r\nAfter getting bounced from the palace gates by an enormous ice creature, a frustrated Anna fought back—an act that literally snowballed into a full-blown panic. We tried to buy time for her and the others to escape, but we were backed up against a cliff that crumbled beneath us. Falling down the mountain was starting to become routine. \r\nSora was determined to speak to Elsa, but on the way back to the ice palace, we saw a suspicious man carrying her toward Arendelle. Further along, we crossed paths with the ice creature we'd battled before. Sora realized he was trying to save Elsa too, so we all joined forces and made our way toward the town. \r\nWe soon learned from Kristoff that Anna was in danger, too. Time was running out. As Kristoff and Sven ran ahead, we did our best to keep pace, crossing the icy sea with the help of our big snow-pal. \r\nWe watched helplessly as Anna stepped in to defend her sister and turned to solid ice. A powerful Heartless took shape from the darkness in the man who had attacked them. Knowing only we could stop it, we stepped in and did our small part to defend Arendelle. \r\nThen, we watched in wonder as Anna thawed. It was her selfless act of true love for her sister that dispelled the magic. Elsa, in turn, realized she could control her magic with that same love. Each of them proved to be one of the New Seven Hearts. \r\nWe still didn't have all seven of our guardians, but Larxene claimed the Organization was all but ready for the final clash. We knew Elsa and Anna's happiness would be short-lived if we didn't gather our numbers, and soon. \r\n",

        "Description": "There Sora and the rest of us were, enjoying the pirate life aboard our modest raft, when we suddenly began to run out of sea! We plummeted over a precipice and into the waiting abyss. \r\nWe found ourselves stranded in an endless, white desert—and strangely enough, along came the Black Pearl, coasting somehow atop the sands. Imagine our surprise when we saw its captain, our friend Jack Sparrow, chasing after it on foot. Soon, we too were pursuing the runaway ship. \r\nWe reached a beach where we found Jack's friends waiting—some of them familiar faces. All had come to rescue Jack from Davy Jones' Locker, to which he'd been banished after getting devoured by the Kraken. \r\nUp in the world of the living, Cutler Beckett had acquired the chest containing Davy Jones' heart. He was using it to manipulate Jones and his ship, the Flying Dutchman, and seize control of the whole ocean. \r\nAboard the Pearl, Tia Dalma explained that Jack, too, coveted the chest, to escape his unpaid debt to Jones. \r\nHaving only just escaped from Davy Jones' Locker, we were beset by a swarm of flying Heartless. Sora fell into the sea while fighting them off, and Donald and Goofy dove in after him. We washed up on a lonely island shore, but the Black Pearl was long gone. The only friend we found was Jack Sparrow, who insisted we set out in search of a new ship. \r\nDeep beyond an undersea grotto, we discovered a magnificent ship cached away. Under Jack's guidance, Sora took to the seas once more, but it wasn't long before we were approached by a ship captained by Luxord of Organization XIII. \r\nLuxord invoked the right of parley, and after some brief negotiations with Jack, the two agreed to a race. The stakes: information about a certain \"black box.\" \r\nOur crew won the race, but Luxord tricked Jack into revealing the box's location just the same. Satisfied, the swindler sailed off after the Flying Dutchman, and though Sora was eager to give chase, the ship was badly damaged, so we made for Port Royal to see to repairs instead. \r\nThe repairs, if you'll believe it, involved gathering strange, white crabs with an even stranger power. It appeared the ship we'd been sailing was an enchanted one, and that wasn't the end of the surprises. \r\nWhen the ship was repaired, Jack asked Sora what he sought to do with it. When Sora replied, \"to explore the seas, free as the wind,\" Jack acknowledged him as a true pirate captain, then disappeared. It turned out the Jack we'd been traveling with was just another phantasm sent by the goddess of the sea. \r\nSora was free to sail wherever he pleased. But he also knew the real Jack and his friends had a terrible battle ahead of them, so we set a course for Shipwreck Cove to offer what aid we could. \r\nDespite Luxord's interference, we managed to reach the Black Pearl before it was too late. Our pirate friends were preparing for one last stand against Beckett. We decided to make our way to the Flying Dutchman and help Jack in his fight against Davy Jones. \r\nThe battle was won, but not without sacrifice. To save Will's life, Jack had him run a sword through Davy Jones' heart. With that, Will became the Flying Dutchman's new captain, cursed to be apart from his love, Elizabeth, for ten years at a time. \r\nWe took comfort in the belief that even one day in a decade is still enough time for two hearts to remain connected, and then departed the seas to return to our greater mission. \r\n",

        "Description": "Not long after arriving in San Fransokyo, we met a team of crime-fighting heroes called Big Hero 6. After a near defeat against the Heartless, the team's leader, Hiro, gave Sora an AR device and asked him to train with them. By collecting Sora's data, Hiro would be able to upgrade everyone's abilities and gain the upper hand against the Heartless. \r\nAlways eager to help, \"Keyblade Hero 3\" took to the streets with their new friends. \r\nBy joining forces, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and the Big Hero 6 team successfully put the Heartless to rout. As we celebrated, Hiro explained that Baymax was originally a healthcare robot created by his late brother, Tadashi, and that the Big Hero 6 team had come together to fulfill Tadashi's dream of helping others. \r\nSeeing the connection Hiro and his friends shared reminded Sora of the bond between Roxas and his friends Hayner, Pence, and Olette. \r\nA new threat appeared in San Fransokyo: the Darkubes. They were immune to all forms of attack, and Hiro's analysis revealed that they could only be defeated by attacking the core unit controlling the swarm. As Hiro worked to track that core, the scattered Darkubes threatened the other members of Big Hero 6 before converging on a single location. \r\nA figure appeared dressed in a black coat. It was Riku—or at least what looked like a younger Riku—but this \"Dark Riku\" turned out to be a replica. He admitted the Organization was behind the Darkubes and was employing them to investigate the possibility of recreating a heart from data by using the first chip Hiro made for Baymax. \r\nThough the heroes were able to defeat the Darkubes' core, Dark Riku's words left Sora and Hiro especially shaken. \r\nHiro explained that the current Baymax is actually the second iteration of the robot that his brother, Tadashi, originally created. That meant the chip in Dark Riku's possession must be from the first Baymax, who was lost in another dimension. \r\nWe confronted Dark Riku atop a skyscraper and watched in horror as he summoned the original Baymax, installed the combat chip containing the negative emotions the Darkubes had gathered, and transformed Tadashi's gentle robot into an instrument of war. \r\nSora saw how hard it was for Hiro. Dark Baymax needed to be stopped, but Hiro's friend was still in there somewhere, beneath all the darkness. Bravely, Sora volunteered to step up in Hiro's place, and he and Baymax 2.0 took flight to remove this new threat from San Fransokyo's skies. \r\nHiro destroyed the chip, and with that, Dark Baymax was no more. Thankfully, though, that's not the end of our story. Hiro repaired his old friend so that the original Baymax could go back on duty as a personal healthcare companion. \r\nAll of us were overjoyed, and we joined Big Hero 6 in giving their old friend a warm, heartfelt welcome. \r\n",

We headed to Twilight Town, where we suspected he might be having a spot of tea. \r\nSure enough, we found Merlin at Little Chef's bistro. The wizard produced a picture book: the very book containing the world of Winnie the Pooh and his friends. Sora should have been a familiar face in the Hundred Acre Wood, but for some reason his picture had vanished from the book's cover. Sora decided to pay the wood a visit and figure out what exactly might be going on. \r\n\"You're home,\" said Pooh as he and all his friends welcomed Sora back. Everyone seemed to be safe and happy as they gathered at Rabbit's house, and so Sora was all but ready to go. But before he could, he was roped into helping Rabbit with the garden work. \r\nOnce the last of the harvest was in, Rabbit presented an overjoyed Pooh Bear with a potful of honey. But Pooh's next remarks troubled Sora greatly. Sora realized that Pooh had forgotten him briefly, and that meant their connection had weakened somehow—or been weakened. \r\nSince the last time he'd seen Pooh, Sora had nearly become Xehanort's vessel. What other connections had been broken in the process? Merlin reminded him with a smile that what is lost can always be found again. \r\n",

        "Description": "As we returned to the gummi ship, Chip and Dale called with distressing news: they'd lost contact with Riku and the King within the realm of darkness. Sora let his heart be his guiding key, and we went through the gate that he created. \r\nThe gate led to the Destiny Islands, where Sora found an old Keyblade lying on the beach. We discovered a door that could only lead to the realm of darkness, and Sora proceeded through it alone, leaving the rest of us to anxiously await his return. \r\nSora followed Riku's voice to the shore of a dark sea. There, he found his friend and the King barely holding their own against Aqua, whose heart had been consumed by darkness. Sora prevailed over Aqua, and pulled her from the sea as she began sinking into its depths. At long last, Master Aqua returned to the realm of light. \r\nAqua wasted no time in traveling to Castle Oblivion to awaken Ventus. We decided to go along. As she arrived at the gates, Aqua raised her Keyblade and unlocked the castle, restoring it to its original form, the Land of Departure. \r\nInside, we found Ventus asleep on a throne, but we were not alone; Vanitas had followed us in yet another bid to take control of Ventus by force. \r\nAqua fought gallantly against Vanitas to protect her brother-in-training and keep the rest of us out of danger, but her opponent's underhanded tactics proved too much for her. As Vanitas raised his Keyblade to deliver the final blow, Sora cried out for help…with all his heart. \r\nThere, deep down inside him, he heard the voice of Ventus, who revealed the power of waking had been inside Sora all along. \r\nSora's power of waking returned Ventus's heart to his body, turning the tide of the battle and forcing Vanitas to retreat. Aqua and Ventus rejoiced in each other's company, the two lost Keyblade wielders reunited at long last. \r\n",

        "Title": "The Keyblade Graveyard",
        "Description": "The thirteen seekers of darkness and seven guardians of light convened in the Keyblade Graveyard, and the Keyblade War began anew. \r\nSora and the others cut through legions of Heartless, Nobodies, and Unversed, oblivious to the true dangers that awaited them. Terra-Xehanort appeared, and single-handedly struck down Ventus and Axel. Donald mustered all of his magical might to blast our foe away, but collapsed from the exhaustion afterwards. \r\nThen, a Demon Tide broke loose from the realm of darkness and consumed all of our friends. Our light had expired before it could so much as flicker. Crushed, Sora wept. \"Alone, I'm worthless. We've lost.\" \r\nBut as shadow washed over the rest of us, Riku reminded his friend: \"You don't believe that. I know you don't.\" \r\nSora awoke in a world of nothing but sea and sky. He'd seen this place in his dreams before. But this wasn't sleep. \r\nHe encountered a strange creature named Chirithy, who told him he was in The Final World. While Sora's heart had survived utter destruction, his physical form had been fragmented, and so he set about piecing himself back together. \r\nWhole once more, he wished with all his heart to save his friends, and returned to the legion of shadow that had consumed him. \r\nThat's when I realized I was still here, too. I encouraged Sora to explore the worlds we'd been to and free the hearts of our lost friends. \r\nSora pursued his friends' captor through dark corridor after dark corridor, freeing their hearts one by one—all except Kairi's. It was then that Chip and Dale told us the way to the Keyblade Graveyard had reopened. \r\nBefore we could go look for Kairi, though, Young Xehanort appeared and offered up a cryptic warning: that Sora was misusing the power of waking, and would pay a high price for it. What did he mean? \r\nWe returned to the site of our defeat, where Sora was reunited with Kairi amidst the Demon Tide's darkness. Kairi never stopped believing in Sora, and the pure light within her—one of the New Seven Hearts—was what kept his heart from being extinguished. She took his hand and, together, they left the dark to a familiar sight: the Keyblade Graveyard, shortly before we made our last stand. \r\nA heart of light, so long as it retains even the faintest glow, will always rise to banish the darkness, as sure as dawn sweeps away the night. \r\nSo it was that Terra's lingering will awakened and began wresting control of his body back from Xehanort. So it was that Keyblade wielders from the past came and fought alongside Sora against the great Demon Tide. And so it was that Yen Sid, Donald, and Goofy stood bravely against a sea of Heartless. \r\nThe many bonds we shared became our courage and our armor as we pressed on to settle things with Organization XIII once and for all. \r\nRiku had been holding his ground alone against Dark Riku and Xigbar—and Ansem, who retreated when Sora joined the fight. \r\nThe two friends defeated Dark Riku, who insisted the Riku on our side was the fake. But the final judgment was rendered by a third Riku—the replica inside Riku's heart. He could have seized Dark Riku's body for his own, but instead the replica sacrificed himself in order to tear Dark Riku free of the vessel, so that it could be saved for Naminé. \r\nXigbar was defeated as well, asserting with his final words that he too was worthy of wielding a Keyblade. With the present fight ended, Riku took off after Ansem, while Sora pressed onward to the next battle. \r\nSora arrived to find the King single-handedly facing Marluxia, Larxene, Luxord, and Xemnas. Seeing the tide of battle shift, Xemnas made a hasty retreat, leaving his fellow Organization members to be defeated one by one. \r\nLuxord, empowered by Xemnas, trapped the King in a card and challenged Sora to one final game. Sora saw through the ruse and emerged victorious. With his final breath, Luxord offered praise for the young Keyblade wielder. As for Larxene, she claimed she'd never truly been in Master Xehanort's corner, but was sticking by someone else. And Marluxia's defeat seemed to kindle his heart and trigger memories of who he once was. \r\nAnother small battle had been won. King Mickey went after Xemnas, and Sora continued on to help the others. \r\nVentus and Aqua were waging their own battles: he against Vanitas, and she against Terra-Xehanort. Sora arrived just in time to level the playing field. \r\nVanitas's mask was shattered, revealing a face identical to Sora's beneath it. Even as he perished, he refused to come into the light, insisting that light is defined by shadow. \r\nAs for Terra-Xehanort, Aqua and Ventus were careful not to harm their friend's body too gravely, but Terra-Xehanort refused to cease his vicious onslaught. Thankfully, their bonds of friendship won out. With a rasp, Terra spoke with his own voice for the first time in forever, and he banished Xehanort from his body once and for all. The three friends, battered but unbroken, celebrated their long overdue reunion while Sora pushed onward to the next battle. \r\nAxel and Kairi were still new to the Keyblade, and it was showing as they tried to fend off Saïx and another black coat. \r\nAs Xemnas prepared to finish off the \"traitor\" Axel, the mysterious third figure came to Axel's defense. Her name was Xion, and the connection that she and Axel shared was finally enough to awaken Roxas from within Sora and to call him back into this world. \r\nSora and the others now held the advantage, but Xemnas refused a peaceful end. He grabbed Kairi and fled. Roxas and Xion took Axel and Kairi's place in battle and helped Sora tame Saïx's rage. Before expiring, Saïx rekindled his friendship with Axel. Kairi's abduction was a crushing blow, but Sora knew he had to keep going. \r\nWith the gauntlet of battles fought and won, Sora rejoined Riku and the King. The three of them faced off against Xehanort in his various forms; they had no choice, now that Kairi was Xehanort's hostage. \r\nWith one light or another, Xehanort was determined to open Kingdom Hearts. \r\nSora, Riku, and Mickey showed tremendous courage as they defeated Ansem, Xemnas, and Young Xehanort. But these were the very clashes Master Xehanort needed to create the χ-blade. He required just one more. \r\nSora watched in horror as Master Xehanort struck Kairi down. \r\nSora and his friends were filled with rage, yet the moment they struck back at Xehanort, the clash between thirteen darknesses and seven lights was complete, and the χ-blade was forged. \r\nKingdom Hearts was steeped in darkness, and the world around us began to crumble, yet still the guardians of light refused to give up. King Mickey explained that if Xehanort could be drawn away from Kingdom Hearts, its power could be contained by the Keyblade for a time. Sora volunteered to take our nemesis on himself. \r\nWith Donald and Goofy by his side—two faithful friends who had stuck with him through countless adventures—Sora leapt toward Xehanort to cast the old Master through his own portal. \r\n",

        "Description": "As Sora came to, he found himself back in the Final World, the world of ocean and sky. Before he even got his bearings, Chirithy appeared with an unexpected sound in this otherwise quiet world. \r\nChirithy taught Sora how to get Kairi back, but warned him of the great price he would have to pay. But Sora, who had always followed his heart, was determined to save Kairi. He decided to return to the past, existing only as an embodiment of his heart. \r\nSora returned to a point in the past where history had not yet been rewritten. There, he came into contact with the hearts of Ventus and Aqua, both of which were under threat from Terra-Xehanort. \r\nDeep within Ventus's heart, Sora battled a physical manifestation of the darkness, and as he traced his way into Aqua's heart, he came face to face with her fear and despair. \r\nSora proceeded to the world where there was no defeat. There, his heart was approached by Naminé's. Seeing that Terra's heart was lost deep in the darkness, Naminé had instead brought with her Terra's will, which embodied his fear, anger, and regret. It is with these unbridled emotions that Terra's lingering will confronted Terra-Xehanort. \r\nWhereas Terra-Xehanort represented Terra's physical body, the lingering will represented the tangible elements in his heart. The clash between these two entities would be devastating for Terra. In an effort to stop this, Sora followed the connection between hearts and joined the fight. Exhausted, Sora was caught off guard and lost consciousness. \r\nAs time continued to flow in the world of the past, Sora suddenly found himself inside Terra's heart. The true Terra had protected him from Terra-Xehanort's darkness. \r\nEncouraged, Sora resumed following the connection between hearts. \r\nThe next heart Sora arrived at was Roxas's. As Sora touched upon Roxas's heart, the memories of Roxas that were inside Xion also flooded into him. \r\nFor Roxas, it was not enough to merely return as he was. He needed to restore the connection he shared with his dearest friends, and reaffirm their bond. So with Sora's help, Roxas, Axel, and Xion recovered the Recusant's Sigil from Xemnas, the curse that binded them together in friendship. \r\nMeanwhile, it appeared as if events in the past could not be changed after all, as Kairi was abducted during the battle, just as before. But now, having followed the connections to five guardians—Ventus, Aqua, Terra, Roxas, and himself—Sora only needed to follow two more guardians' hearts before he finally reached Kairi's. \r\nBefore Sora was able to follow the next connection, he was forced to witness Kairi's essence being shattered yet again. \r\nBut while in the depths of despair, Sora heard the voice of the King. He informed Sora that Kairi could still be saved—Master Xehanort needed to keep her as insurance until Kingdom Hearts appeared. \r\nArmed with this knowledge, Sora jumped into Master Xehanort's portal before his past self caught up. \r\nSora failed to find Kairi in Scala ad Caelum, but by reaching the hearts of five guardians, he had found five fragments of her heart. He was certain that if he could follow the connection the remaining two guardians, he could find Kairi. \r\nAnd so, Sora followed the connection to Riku, then to King Mickey. \r\nFinally, Sora and Kairi were reunited. But before they could celebrate their reunion, Master Xehanort descended upon them. \r\nThe guardians of light, armed with the power of connecting hearts, succeeded in thwarting Master Xehanort's foul ambition, and in turn, Kingdom Hearts slowly faded into the clouds. \r\nThe world of ocean and sky—the Final World. Sora found himself here yet again, this time with Kairi's hand in his. \r\nBut this time, Sora had a purpose. He was determined to reunite Chirithy with its friend. With a smile, Sora extended his hand—\"Let's go!\" \r\n",
