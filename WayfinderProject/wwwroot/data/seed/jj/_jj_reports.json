As ruler of this world, I must find the answers. I must find them before the world is lost to those taken by the darkness.",

How fragile our hearts are! My treatment produced no signs of recovery. I confined those who had completely lost their hearts beneath the castle. Some time later, I went below and was greeted by the strangest sight. Creatures that seemed born of darkness... What are they? Are they truly sentient beings? Could they be the shadows of those who lost their hearts in my experiments?",

Therefore, they also lack Kairi's memories. One reason for this maybe that Kairi's heart did not return to the darkness when separated from her body, but rather migrated to another vessel... deep within Sora's heart. \r\nThat is, NaminÃ© is an alter ego of the Kairi who has directly interfered with Sora's heart. Could this be why Sora and those hearts are connected to him were able to have their memories controlled? \r\nShe is a \"non-being\" in the truest sense of the word; having not even become a Nobody and with nowhere left to go, she is but the most fleeting of shadows. \r\n",

It would take quite some time to bring back all the memories he had created in his lifetime.  \r\nBut Organization XIII held sway over Castle Oblivion. Sora would need to be kept someplace more secure. \r\nI persuaded NaminÃ© to move the slumbering Sora to Twilight Town for safekeeping. \r\nNaminÃ© . \r\nAs I have written before, she is a most unusual being. \r\nBorn of the same process as a Nobody, but lacking virtually all the elements of a Nobody. \r\nPerhaps she continues drawing in hopes of capturing that which she lacks: the memories of others, especially Sora. \r\nI have arrived at a hypothesis. \r\nI believe that NaminÃ© was born as a special type of Nobody when Sora attacked himself with the Keyblade, causing his and Kairi's hearts to leave their bodies simultaneously. \r\nNaminÃ© emerged as Kairi's Nobody... but the body and soul necessary to exist as a Nobody belonged to Sora. \r\nWhen a person's heart is stolen, a Heartless is born with no sense of self, and the body and soul left behind give rise to a Nobody. \r\nBut what if one willingly releases one's heart from one's body? \r\nSora and Xehanort retained their selfhood even after becoming Heartless. \r\nThen there are Kairi and NaminÃ©. \r\nKairi was exceptional for having had no darkness within her heart. Also exceptional was that her heart, once freed, migrated to a new vessel- Sora. \r\nThe combination of the two theoretically unlikely exceptions may be behind this anomaly. \r\nThere are matters I must attend to while Sora is sleeping. \r\nA new ally has appeared on the scene: Riku. \r\n",

It consists of the remnants of worlds whose hearts have been stolen by the Heartless. \r\nIt is where those who have barely escaped the destruction of their worlds eventually find themselves. \r\nThis \"realm between\" is quite unstable, with corridors of darkness appearing from time to time. \r\nWhenever a world disappears, some of its inhabitants must arrive here through these corridors. Surely Sora traveled these same corridors of darkness when he first came to Traverse Town. \r\nIt seems my friend, fighting in the realm of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion through a corridor of darkness constructed by Organization XIII. \r\nMy new ally Riku also effected his return via one of these corridors. \r\nHe swore to me he would give his all for his best friend Sora. \r\nIn fact, Sora's memories have been slow to return. \r\nThus I have asked Riku to bring me another Sora- his Nobody. \r\nSora is indispensable if I am to achieve my goal. \r\nI require the Keyblade-wielding hero to fly through the realm of light and defeat Organization XIII. \r\n",

NaminÃ© is Kairi's Nobody, but came into being via Sora's body and soul. \r\nLikewise, Roxas is Sora's Nobody, but was left behind because Sora's Heartless regained human form using Kairi's heart instead of his own. \r\nIt may be that Sora's memories are slow to return because the half of him that Roxas is still lacking. \r\nI must convert Roxas into data and return him to Sora. \r\nAs a member of Organization XIII, it was exceedingly difficult to bring Roxas in. Having lost to Roxas once, Riku laid everything on the line and used the power of darkness in their second battle, only just managing to bring Roxas back with him. \r\nBut Organization XIII grows ever nearer. Here, Twilight Town, is where Roxas was reborn as a Nobody. \r\nThis is where Roxas first encountered Organization XIII and joined its ranks. They are bound to search this place thoroughly. \r\nFirst I shall convert all of Twilight Town into data and construct a \"world duplicate\" in Sora's memories. I shall place Roxas within that world to live out his days and regain those memories. \r\nThere is little time. \r\nThe Organization's schemes must be making steady progress as well. \r\n",

It was a heavy mantle our Master placed upon your shoulders naming you Successor, but you have nonetheless persevered and raised two Masters yourself. I know it cannot be easy. \r\nI did you terrible harm in the past over a petty difference in opinion, and just a few years ago selfishly thrust my own burdens upon you. I think of you like a younger brother, and yet, fool that I am, I have never availed myself of countless opportunities to apologize or thank you for opening your home to the boy. Yet not once have you blamed me; on the contrary, here you are inviting me to such an important ceremony. I intend to be there to offer you all my blessings. \r\nOur Master chose his heir wisely. Ours is a bizarrely ironic taskâ€”to watch over the light from the shadowsâ€”but in the face of that, the warmth in your heart and unfailing dedication to the light impress me to no end. \r\nI have taken to wandering the World, and seen much darkness hiding in the light. Lately, I fear it has taken a turn for the worse. Perhaps Yen Sid has already told you about the Unversed? These fledgling emotions derive from negativity, and I can now sense their presence in nearly every world. \r\nAnd on the topic of darkness: we must speak of another matter that concerns me, one related to the upcoming ceremony. When I visited several years ago, your pupil Terra drew my attention. His power is immense, to be sure, but within his heart I could see darkness just waiting to be awakened. I know this is none of my business, but I have reservations about welcoming Terra as a true Keyblade Master without taking certain precautions. The traditional examination, perhaps, to see if he has the Mark of Mastery? The choice is yours, and I will humbly respect your decision. \r\nTake care. I eagerly await our long overdue reunion. \r\n",

A whole spectrum of thought was swept into the conflict, and the worlds that did not go to war found the war brought to them. In the end, the whole World was cast into darkness. That was how the ancient Keyblade War drew to a close. To this day, no one has ever managed to open the door to Kingdom Hearts. \r\nSome time later, the little light that remained in the hearts of the few gave rise to the World we know today: one made of many worlds behind just as many walls, so that the Keyblade War would not be repeated. \r\n",

Mastered. \r\nEraqus is a blueblood, descended from the very first masters in the age of fairy tales. But I did not come this far to indulge in adulation. I will be his peer. His equal. And to do that, I must learn to wield the power born from both darkness and light in proper balance. \r\nâ€”Xehanort \r\n",

After seven days' observation, she spoke her first words, but could not provide a name. Subject exhibits signs of profound amnesia, and displays concern for which world this is. Her words suggest that she departed her home world with others, though she cannot recall the names of her erstwhile companions. All efforts to explore those memories have met with a rejection response. \r\nAfter his initial experiments on me, Ansem the Wise ceased his research into the heart, his hand stayed by some fear I cannot fathom. Yet this new subject is like me: devoid of memories. She is the perfect sample upon which to continue my master's work. She, too, could benefit from it; by traversing the heart, we have a direct path into memory. I myself have begun to reclaim my lost past thanks to these very experiments. \r\nWho is she? Whence has she come? These are questions no scientist could ignore. And the words she muttered, \"May your heart be your guiding key\"... \r\nâ€”Xehanort \r\n",

Ultimately, all suffered mental collapse. I knew it would be a heavy blow to lose a subject as unique as she. \r\nUpon discovering the tests I've been conducting, my master demanded that I cease my work immediately and destroy what research I have compiled. Worse still, he ordered the release of my remaining subjects. She is gone. \r\nWhere is Subject X now? Has \"wise\" Master Ansem hidden her away? Whatever the case, I will not be deterred.

Within its walls, Ansem the Wise conducted his research, and the fruits it bore allowed everyone outside to live in peace and happiness. That alone was enough to stoke our interest, though not all of the rumors that escaped its walls were so benevolent. By night, the muffled sounds of human wails emerged. There was talk of dangerous human experimentation. Lea and I couldn't help but hatch a plot to steal inside and sate our curiosity. \r\nThe two who stood guard at the gates were researchers themselves, though you wouldn't think it to see them, massive and barrel-chested as they were. And slipping past that duo was only the first hurdle. It proved one not easily cleared; we were found and tossed out on our ears, time and again. \r\nOn the day we finally secured our entry, we descended the long spiral stair at the heart of the castle to find a dark space below it, lined with cages. There wasn't light enough to see if they were inhabited, and we were in no position to call out to any occupants within. Yet we could feel it. A definite presence, there in the black. Terror washed over us, and we immediately regretted coming. But just as we turned to flee, we heard the faintest of voices. The urge to run was nigh overpowering, but someone or something beckoned us on. \r\nThere, framed by a tenuous sliver of light, we found her. \r\nâ€”SaÃ¯x \r\n",

We slipped into the castle that day knowing only that we wanted, with all our hearts, to save her. \r\nBut we did not find her inside on that day or the next, or any of our subsequent visits.

Even after waking, I remained in bed, pondering my next course of action. \r\nIn my work on the Replica Program for the Organization, I produced some twenty vessels. Most of the early results were failures, not one of them granted a number. The first success to emerge from that early lot was the Riku replica. Subsequently, Xion (No. i) was essentially indistinguishable from a natural human, though she became unstable due to the influence of others. Using those two as my foundation, I worked to construct a number of nigh-perfect replicas, but just as they neared completion, my efforts were cut short. I suspect Xehanort aims to use both the initial lot as well as the unused replicas from my later work. \r\nI arose today and decided to walk out in the square, my first outing in some time. Yet my stroll was interrupted when a surprising visitor appeared with an unexpected offer. Though younger than me, he'd risen to become Xemnas's right-hand. I accepted his terms and became a Nobody once moreâ€”easier to gain access to the old Replica Program that way. \r\nWhatever it takes to atone. \r\nâ€”Vexen \r\n",

The old man's humanity prevents his Heartless and Nobody, others vanquished in the past, and his younger self from being denizens of this time. \r\nTo circumvent this, Xehanort is using the prototype replicas I created in the past as containers, plucking his other selves' hearts from the time they existed. Xehanort ordered me to refine the prototypes, to make them closer still to the real thing. Perfecting my creations so they may house true, flesh-and-blood humans suits my own purposes as well.

        "Description": "I have pored over the data my master entrusted to Riku. Here, I offer my preliminary conclusions. \r\nWithin Sora's heart are three compartmentalized \"boxes,\" each containing the heart of another. One box holds Roxas. Another holds a second heart that has been with Sora nearly as long. The third has held its heart for much longer. These hearts have melded with Sora's and no longer have voices of their own. Any attempt to mechanically extract them could prove as dire for Sora as what caused him to become a Heartless in the first place. \r\nFirst, a vessel for each heart must be readied. Then, a spark of some sort is required to induce its waking. Obviously, the ideal solution is to restore each heart to its own body, but (whatever the case for the two unknown individuals) Roxas possesses no such thing. The same is true for NaminÃ©, who we believe resides in Kairi's heart. Still, if alternate bodies can be secured for them, all their hearts require to be awakened is that \"spark\"â€”people they cared for and who cared for them, who can show them the way home. \r\nComplete and perfect digitization of the heart is impossible. We can only hope to partially reconstruct it. Thus, I see no way forward but to extract the hearts we so desperately need from within Sora. Fortunately, the data stored in Twilight Town contains a near-perfect record of the memories of those who lived thereâ€”and for Roxas and NaminÃ© especially, this is crucial. \r\nâ€”Ienzo \r\n",
