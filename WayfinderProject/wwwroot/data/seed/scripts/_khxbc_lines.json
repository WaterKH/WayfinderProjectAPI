Come to what? The Lost Page? Why are you telling me this, Gula? I have enough to think about keeping with the Master's teachings and my role. But how? But he's not here anymore. What!? Summoning Kingdom Hearts is forbidden! I'm sorry. I know you want the Master to return, but you don't know how summoning Kingdom Hearts will affect the rest of the world. The Master... He forbid it for a reason. I'm afraid I can't help you. Gula's on a mission to collect Lux. Then what's written in the Book, all of it will happen...Invi, what are you going to do? Right..."

Not only do you have your Union but you've also gathered the finest Keyblade wielders from other Unions and you're training them in a secret location, aren't you? I had no idea... I apologize, I overstepped. What did Ira want? I see. And Gula? How is he doing? Ah. That explains why Aced and Ira are as well. They're trying to maintain the balance. But, that isn't the balance we were expected to keep. If everyone's collecting light solely for themselves, Keyblade wielders will soon turn against one another, which will lead to...the Keyblade War. Light will expire. I'll gather Lux, too. No matter what, the balance must be kept. Ava, you do the same. We must...delay the inevitable."

It contains a passage about an inevitable betrayal. It talks about \"the one who bears the sigil.\" That's it. So, I don't know what to make of it to be honest. My role is to find out who it is. I suspected Aced and went to confront him. And look what happened. Always walking the straight and narrow. I'm a fool for basing my actions on what is written on that Lost Page. Everything in the passage is ambiguous at best. That's why I need to find out. By asking the Master. I'm going to summon Kingdom Hearts. Then he'll have no choice but to come back. That's exactly why! The only way to get him back is to break the rules! If things don't change, the entire world is doomed! But, in order to go through with it, I'll need Lux. I don't have nearly enough! You always do the right thing. Help me with this. I see. May your heart be your guiding key."

Don't get involved in any battles, forget the notion of Unions, find Keyblade wielders with potential, and create an entirely separate organization.

Today you're here to continue with your training for our mission. This session may seem like it's familiar to you, but in a world that is different, one made of dreams… You are our hope. A war will soon wage. Those who strive to protect the light will turn their weapons on their allies for the sake of loyalty to their own Unions. To be honest, I don't know how far I can guide all of you. What you must remember is that anyone can lose themselves to the darkness. However, there will be no winners; everything will be lost. Except, all of you who are the seeds of hope. When the time comes, and there is war, you mustn't fight, but instead you must fly away from here to the world outside. This training is to help you fulfill this crucial task. The future is in all your hands--as is the world's light. May your hearts be your guiding key."

Yeah, sure. Anyway, about your role. You need to pass down that Keyblade to your apprentice, and then him to his, so that my eye can see the future. Bingo! The fact that it exists is proof of your success! That means you've trained a worthy apprentice, passed down that handsome Keyblade, and fulfilled your role! Congratulations! What's the matter? Come on, you did a fantastic job! At least smile a little! Good point. Guess you better get started then! Unfortunately, you'll have to go alone from here on out. No Book of Prophecies to keep you company, either. I can't have you causing any temporal paradoxes. But, hey, we both know you'll do just fine without it, right? Minor details, so don't sweat it. For now, you, that Keyblade, and...this box need to stay out of sight. Just watch with your own eyes--and my eye, of course--as things unfold between the others. Then when the time is right, go off and do your thing. It's a secret. And, well, you see... the thing is... you can never, ever open it. Ah, all right. I'll indulge you. But this secret stays between the two of us, and you have to promise never to open the box. You'll see."
