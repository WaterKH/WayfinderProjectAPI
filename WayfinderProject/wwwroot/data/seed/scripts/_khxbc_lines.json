Luxu, the first of the apprentices to be given their role, watched his companions from afar, as they learned what it was that they were meant to do, then, he disappeared. Not long after that, the Master vanished, dimmed, and faded without a trace. This is where your story began, the story of your very own adventure. Five of the Master's apprentices armed themselves with the Book of Prophecies. They each created a Union. This would fulfill his wishes. Then, they set out to rally Keyblade wielders just like you.
