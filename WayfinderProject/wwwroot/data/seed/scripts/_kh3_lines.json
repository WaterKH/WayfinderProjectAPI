However, the darkness nearly took control of you, and your grasp of your new abilities leaves much to be desired. Furthermore, Xehanort nearly made you his vessel, and in the process stripped you of most of the power you had gained by then. I suspect you have already noticed this, correct? But first, you must regain all the strength you have lost. Perhaps it is foolish to expect a complete recovery, but it is absolutely vital you perfect one power- the power of waking, which you failed to master during your exam. There's someone who lost his strength and found it again, a true hero to whom you ought to pay a visit. Perhaps he can point you in the right direction."

But now the planets were aligned and nothing could possibly go wrong.

One is Roxas. The second has been with Sora for nearly as long. And a third has resided in Sora's heart for even longer- most of his life, in fact. This is a truly astonishing discovery. While these hearts have now melded with Sora- grown silent and indistinct- Sora retains the memories of all three. The memories have been compartment-alized- each placed in its own 'box,' so to speak. I surmise the hearts can be awoken, provided that each of them is returned to the box that  contains the correct memories. Unite the heart with its memories, and provide it a suitable body within which it may flourish, and I believe any or all three of these people can be made real again.\""

Every emotion that each of the guardians felt... sadness, anxiety, fear, kindness. Everything they saw, and everything that they felt then, you'll clear a way through it, traverse across their hearts, and dive ever deeper inside.
