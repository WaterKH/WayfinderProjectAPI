A lot has changed over time, but there's always been one constant in my life—you. I first saw you at Fountain Square. You were waiting for someone, but they never came. When I returned from my mission that day, you were still there—waiting. You looked so disappointed. I saw your eyes well up as you hugged Chirithy. Since that day, I began to see you everywhere. It was strange because we must've crossed paths so many times before... But I didn't really notice you until that day. I wanted to say hi... but I could never muster up the courage. While everyone else was going about their days without question, you began to doubt your mission, your purpose. You saw there was something more, something we weren't being told. You don't know me, but I feel like I know you. I hope that one day we can be friends. There's so much I'd like to tell you. "
