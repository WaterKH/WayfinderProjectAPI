To tell ya the truth, I never expected it to have the same kinda power as the real Keyblade. That weapon was just a replica; it didn't have any substance. That's why Maleficent could destroy it so easily. But, during your journey, you really made a connection with all of us. You've become more than the system, Sora. The power you found inside of you isn't like anybody else's. And when you accessed that power, that's what brought your Keyblade back. Well, that's what I believe anyway.

Your memories disappeared too, but you managed to get those back. For some reason, though, the pages of the journal---they stayed blank. It makes sense. Everything in Jiminy's journal revolved around one person, and that person is you, Sora. Without you, there never would have been any entries. This whole time you've been evolving in the datascape, finding new strength, your Heartless has been absorbing data and doing the same. It's grown, Sora. Just like you have. No... I should have realized all of this sooner. Normally, defeating a Heartless causes its heart to be released. Then the heart's returned to the person who lost it. But when you defeat Heartless here in the datascape---that wouldn't set any real hearts free. Remember, Sora, hearts can't be turned to data. Instead, I think what you released are probably the Heartless's minds. They're right in front of you! Your Heartless has been gathering, then devouring the dark intentions of all the fallen Heartless. That's where it gets its power. From dark data!

It's not a game! It's way past time that you learned what real hurt feels like! Come on, Sora. Do it. Finish me off! Why won't you do it?...I get it. You've seen through my disguise. I'm just like everyone else you've encountered in this place---made of data. I'm not even worth the effort, is that what it is? Guess there's no point in destroying something if it never existed. Is that right? \"Can't be all that bad\"? All right, I give up. Here. You pass, Sora. Congratulations, you understand hurt. Now, use this to find the truth. My role was to see if you were ready to take ownership of the hurt inside you. And now that role is done. Nothing left for me to do, but...go away. I don't know if I really have one. But...there's a place I'd like to be. Summer vacation."

It'll stay inside of my heart, until the day I remember. If I put the hurt aside, I'll lose my ties to all the people I care about. My mind's made up. I may end up falling into the darkness, but I'll carry this with me. I'll only get rid of it when I remember everything, and not a day sooner than that. I'll keep the hurt with me for the time being. It's all that I have. It's what holds the pieces in place. I accept that. Not at all. You say that you're an illusion, but you certainly pack a really big punch. You said that you'd show me hurt, and you weren't wrong. Actually, the hurt that I just felt...was more than that. Sure, it might have hurt while we were fighting, but I sensed a different kind of hurt from you. It was kind of like...an intense, sharp pain. But it... felt sort of familiar, almost like it was my own. As if we'd been connected, like right then we shared the same hurt. If somehow, it brings me closer to people in that kind of way...then carrying around a little hurt can't be all that bad. What do you mean? Are you gonna go back home? A place? Uh...where? What's...this feeling? I've got memories that don't belong to me. A place to call home. And a sunset, that's comforting. My first and my last...You can rest easy. I've got you now. Mickey! It's okay.

Uh-huh! Who...? Naminé, that's you! Who's the other girl? She feels so...familiar. ...And something happened. Something terrible. Didn't it? Funny. I feel as though...I've met them. Yeah...

But it was also me... I was the one who took them apart in the first place. Not only that, the reason all of the bugs appeared in Jiminy's journal... That was me. It all began with these memories that were sleeping way down deep---deep in Sora's heart. Actually, no, they're not yours. They belong to people who are connected to you. Yes, usually it's impossible. When I first found them while repairing your memory, I thought I had made some sort of mistake. But then, after searching for answers, all the evidence I found proved they belong in your heart. Sora will have to awaken these memories, but this is where they will sleep until that time comes. They are important...and yet, dangerous too. These memories, all of them are too painful. Handled the wrong way, they could damage Sora's heart, even break it. That's why I needed for Sora to find a way to face that kind of hurt. So I left the message for all of you. When I unraveled Sora and the others' memories, it also erased the words  in Jiminy's journal. That book was filled with pages and pages of memories from your first adventure. It shows how deeply the journal and Sora are connected. When I took Sora's memories apart, they stayed in his heart. It may have looked like they were gone, but they were there the whole time. Even after the text disappeared from the journal, the memories remained. That's why you were able to render them as data. That was...me, too. When I added these memories to the journal, I also added all this \"hurt.\" I thought that maybe if you fought the bugs that sprang from these memories, you might learn to face the hurt in the memories themselves. I'm sorry. I wish I could have told you this in person. But the real me is gone. She doesn't exist now. You don't have to understand it. You have already learned how to face the hurt, Sora. You most certainly did. At times, the pain can be wiped away. But there's also a pain that always stays with you. There's only one way to deal with that; you face it head-on and then you accept it. And if it happens that the hurt is too great for you to bear it alone, well, then you turn to a friend close to your heart. Sora...Thank you. Just touch this. Don't be afraid. You'll feel all of the memories that are locked inside flow right into your hearts. These are hidden truths. Sora has been keeping them locked away, deep inside of him. Remember, these memories you're feeling, they don't belong to him. They're waiting for Sora. He's the only one who can put an end to their hurt. DiZ told me...he hid something inside you during the year you were asleep. I asked him what, and all he would say was that he was \"clearing his conscience.\" Sora must be the key to saving the people you saw...and the ones you're about to see. Maybe YOU know how much they're hurting. These three were keys, too. They were connected to the Keyblade's truth. And, they're still connected, Sora, somewhere way down deep inside of you. Yes, two of them, you have met. As for the third, I never realized it, but...you and he share a very special connection. I can't say for sure. But I do know a day will come when they must rise from their sleep. And then, the only one who can save them...will be Sora. Please do. Well---Huh? I may be gone, but my promises to him are forever. And anyway, I owe this much. For all the...all those people that I hurt. I'm really just data made to pass along a message. I shouldn't exist right now in this journal at all. And now the record of me will disappear. But when you pass my message on to the other Sora, just remember to tell him the things that you've seen, and that you've felt. If you do that, then we'll be at rest---her, and me too. Hm?"

Yeah, but the data we got was a mess, and then all those bugs appeared. Jiminy never wrote about any bugs. So that's what it was. I didn't realize you had to go through so much trouble to get us to investigate this hurt, Naminé. Wait! You're not in this alone. Always remember, I'm here, too. Sora, be strong! It can't be! Naminé. You said Sora has to call these memories to the surface. Is it time? The bond they all share---that's gonna be the key, right? Don't worry, Naminé. I'll make sure I pass this on to Sora---you know, the one in the outside world! And so ended our journey to connect \"those\" memories with \"these.\" Sora, when Naminé's words are passed on to you, when the day comes that you learn of this great unknown and mysterious adventure, it's important that you understand, whatever you feel in your heart, that's what \"he\" felt in his."
