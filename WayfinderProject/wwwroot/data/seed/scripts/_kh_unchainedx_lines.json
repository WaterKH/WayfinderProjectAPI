The five read the manuscript, and were shocked by the final entry. \"The fated land will be the battleground for a great war. Light will see defeat and expire, while darkness prevails evermore.\" They decided to draw on the powers of the book to prevent that from happening. The Medals you're using are one of those powers. They harness unimaginable forces from the future to protect light and keep the world safe from the inevitable darkness. As for the foretellers, you should know that they share the same goal, but they don't follow the same path. Don't lose sight of yours, okay?"

The worlds we visit- the worlds of fairy tales- are nothing more than holograms. You know, projections. The light we collect there is actually this world's light. Umm, to put it simply- There are lots of worlds, right? And they're all connected by land. But it's impossible to go around to all of them. That's why there's a mechanism that projects those worlds here and allows us to collect Lux from far away lands. I'm gathering information, trying to figure out how the whole thing works. My hunch is that the Book of Prophecies held by the foretellers is what's creating these holograms. Get it? Or have I lost you? Good. Anyway, we're in this town, gathering the light that belongs to this vast world. Not just gathering, fighting over it, without knowing why. Ater a little digging, I discovered that all the Unions have different goals. What is it? Really? Interesting... Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you come with me? Great!

Why don't you put it  somewhere for safekeeping? With that bracelet, you can protect yourself against darkness.  You'll need it for the special mission we got from the foretellers. You'll be doing the same thing, you know, dealing with monsters...just in a different, darker place... Your mission is to defeat the Heartless in the Corridor of Darkness. But be careful. That bracelet can only protect you for so long. I knew I could count on you, kiddo. Now go and get 'em! I'm rootin' for you!"
