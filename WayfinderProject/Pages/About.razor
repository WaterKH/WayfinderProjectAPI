                    The Wayfinder Project was started in the spring of 2021 by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSubparPatsby" target="_blank"><strong>Regular Pat</strong></a> (that’s me!)
                    I work as a full-time content creator with a focus on videos about my favorite series, Kingdom Hearts.
                    I’ve been making Kingdom Hearts content since August of 2019, and was recipient of the Million Dreams Award for Content Creator of the Year at the KH20 Celebration.
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RegularPat" target="_blank">You can check out my channel here</a>. Given that making videos about the series is what I do for a living,
                    I decided it’d be a good idea to invest some time in streamlining the process as much as possible;
                    too often did I find myself scrubbing through multi-hour long cutscene compilations or skimming through one of the game’s Theater Modes to find the exact piece of footage that
                    I needed for the video essay or ranking project that I was working on.
                </p>
            }
            else if (this.CurrentView == "Wayfinder")
            {
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    Thus, I embarked on a long and nerdy quest to watch each and every cutscene in the KH series and catalog every piece of information about them in
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13opj3BQ6eEZEaV6GSNmLamZOQYCojUIgU93eUCneInQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">a Google Sheets file</a>.
                    I had completed work on KH1, ReCoM and 2 for my own purposes, but since it had been so helpful for me,
                    I decided to finish documenting the rest of the series and make the project public for anyone to use.
                    In September of 2021, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdgc6m0ACCQ" target="_blank">I posted a video explaining the original Sheets version of the Wayfinder Project</a>
                    and made it accessible to everyone. It is easily one of my favorite things I’ve done during my time in the KH community.
                </p>
            }
            else if (this.CurrentView == "WaterKH")
            {
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    In August of 2022, I was approached by <a href="https://twitter.com/water_kh" target="_blank"><strong>waterkh</strong></a>, an incredibly talented and dedicated modder in the community
                    (and a winner of a Million Dreams Award himself, for Mods & Customizations.)
                    He had the idea of transforming the project from a Sheets file into a dedicated database and website, complete with a much cleaner and more functional UI.
                    As we discussed what was essentially the creation of the Wayfinder Project 2.0, we also decided the database could be made even more useful by adding every cutscene’s script to it,
                    a feature that was simply unfeasible for the Google Sheets version of the project.
                    Now, instead of using CTRL+F to maybe find a memorable line or keyword I left in the notes section, you can search up literally any word in the series and find the exact scene you’re looking for.
                    I cannot thank Water enough for his help and the massive upgrade he gave to the project! The new and improved Wayfinder Project was launched to the public on 09/13/2022.

                    My wonderful community, especially my Patreon supporters, for both their moral and financial support– I would not have been able to comfortably sink as much time as I did into this project without their generosity.

                    At the very least, it gives me peace of mind to know that other people have gotten mileage or enjoyment out of this mind-numbing labor of love. Thank you!
