# WayfinderProjectAPI
A Web API for the Wayfinder Project

# How To Use
There is only one endpoint at this time, which can be found here: https://wayfinderprojectkh.com/swagger/index.html. Using this endpoint, you can retrieve any scene with a GET request, like: https://wayfinderprojectkh.com/api/Wayfinder/SearchForScenes?characters=Sora

The list of acceptable names for music, scenes, characters, etc. can be found in this repository under wwwroot/data/seed.


# Website
There is also a [Wayfinder Project Website](https://wayfinderprojectkh.com) that uses this API. More information can be found over there about the project and how to use it.
